These transitions will require substantial investment in technology across industry sectors. Your company is making significant investments and building capabilities to partner with customers during this phase of rapid technological shifts.Letter from the Chairman   \\n6\\nIntegrated Annual Report 2023-24\\nLetter from the\\nChairman\\nDear Shareholder,\\nIn FY 2024, your company has continued to deliver strong \\nperformance. I am pleased to share with you that your company has crossed annual revenues of ₹240,893 crore, a growth of \\n6.8%, over the previous year. With relentless focus on operational excellence, this growth has come at an industry leading operating margin of 24.6%*,  an increase from 24.1% last year. The order \\nbook for FY 2024 came at an all-time high of US$ 42.7 billion  \\nsupported by strong client relationships and engagement. Client metrics continue to exhibit healthy progress with strong client additions. Employee retention continues to be at benchmark levels in the industry. TCS has been selected as a Top Employer of Choice in 32 countries. TCS has retained its ranking as the second most valuable global IT services brand, valued at US$19.2 billion,  \\nan increase of US$2 billion  from last year.\\nThe global environment around the world continues to go through significant shifts. Post the pandemic, which resulted in supply chain shocks, there was an economic slowdown especially in developed markets. While initial signs of stability began to emerge, the military conflicts have further intensified this year and continue to impact the global supply chains. After two years of recessionary fears, persistently high inflation, and unprecedented monetary tightening, the global macro-outlook looks relatively better now with improving growth, disinflation, and monetary easing in sight.Across industries globally, there are multiple mega trends that are shaping priorities of businesses: AI, New Energy, Supply \\nChain and Talent. \\n• GenAI technologies will impact almost every sector and country going forward. Enterprises have already invested in cloud, data infrastructure and large processing power which will aid AI/ GenAI. GenAI will not only improve productivity, but also create impact we hitherto have not seen or imagined. \\n• Global energy transition is accelerating, and businesses are making clear commitments towards a sustainable future. The energy requirement of our fast-changing world is enormous. Key is to lower the cost of energy while also transitioning to renewables. This transition requires large investment in technology, electric mobility, renewable power, hydrogen and sustainable fuel. \\n*Excludes settlement of legal claim Letter from the Chairman   \\n7\\nIntegrated Annual Report 2023-24\\n• Geo-political challenges are continuing to alter established \\nsupply chains and companies are rebalancing their supply chains to address both resilience and efficiency. New global supply chain ecosystems are being created, with India playing an important role in advanced manufacturing.\\n• Advanced manufacturing, new technologies like AI, new energy, data and business models are changing the future of work and are compelling new skillsets to be built for the future. \\n• Secure networks have become a key necessity as data is the foundation for businesses of today. These networks power everything from predictive analytics and AI to personalized customer experiences. As value of data increases, along with concerns of privacy and protection, it has rightly become a focal point of security for all businesses. \\nThe key question is what these disruptions mean to the IT services industry and how your company is preparing for these?As enterprises globally prepare to respond to these mega trends, we see multiple opportunities for your company. Every industry is embracing these trends and their business is being shaped for the future. For example:\\n• The deployment of AI and GenAI will significantly help financial institutions in both driving efficiency as well as target new customers and serve customers in a very \\npersonalized manner. For example, Insurance claims will be processed in a matter of minutes, lending and disbursements will become much faster.\\n• Adoption of new energy solutions and AI technology is driving the future of automobiles. It is not only driving reduction of emissions but also providing a new level of customer experience. \\n• AI is accelerating drug development by screening millions of compounds, predicting interactions and generating new candidates for testing.\\n• Connected medical devices together with AI and GenAI will transform Healthcare in a significant way. It will enhance productivity, enable remote care and help overcome shortage of skilled resources.\\n• In Advanced manufacturing, an AI-first approach will drive new benchmarks in productivity, efficiency and sustainability. \\n• Telecom industry globally is upgrading communication infrastructure to 5G/6G. These high speed, low latency networks, along with edge compute and AI will become the backbone of businesses in future.These transitions will require substantial investment in technology across industry sectors. Your company is making significant investments and building capabilities to partner with customers during this phase of rapid technological shifts:\\n• In FY 2024, TCS has consolidated AI and Cloud expertise with the creation of the AI.Cloud unit. In addition, each of the business groups are developing domain-specific AI/GenAI offerings relevant to the industry value chain. Over 300,000 employees have been upskilled on GenAI technologies in FY 2024. TCS’ products and services are also being enhanced with AI capabilities. For example, TCS BaNCS\\nTM is enriching its product portfolio with integrated \\nAI/ML and GenAI capabilities; AI is also being embedded in Cybersecurity services to enable predictive capabilities.\\n• To partner with customers on their energy transition agenda, TCS is investing in research on green hydrogen, biofuels; developing digital platforms to help customers reduce Scope 1/2/3 emissions. Our proprietary ESG framework enables enterprises to build transparency into operations and simplifies compliance reporting.\\n• TCS is pioneering the engineering of the 5G/6G communication stacks using open standards. Two state-of-the-art labs for future ready communication infrastructure and interoperability have been setup at Bengaluru and Gurugram. Investments are being made in multiple niche technologies such as 5G SA Core, O-RAN radios, to build these solutions indigenously.\\n• Your company continues to invest in upskilling its talent base of over  600,000 employees. Employees are actively leveraging experiential and personalized learning on a wide range of emerging technologies, clocking over 51 million learning hours in FY 2024. TCS continues to build strong talent supply chains with deep partnerships with leading educational institutions, shaping the curriculum for new skill needs for the future.\\nOn behalf of the Board of Directors of the company, I want to thank you for your continued trust, confidence, and support.\\nWarm regards,\\nN Chandrasekaran\\nChairman Letter from the CEO1\\nIt is my privilege to be writing to you from this desk as we near \\n20 years to our listing since August 25, 2004. Over the last two decades, your company’s Revenue and Net Profits have grown at a compounded annual growth rate of over 18% each.\\nIt has been almost a full year since my transition as CEO, \\nand I am happy to report that it has been a very stable and seamless experience for all our stakeholders. During this period, we refocused on our industry and technology expertise, emphasized and refreshed the core values that define who we are as a company, and doubled down on customer centricity and employee empathy.\\nWe had a strong finish to the fiscal year FY 2024, with revenue \\nfor the year at ₹240,893 crore. This is, a growth of 6.8% over \\nthe previous year (3.4% in constant currency). Demand for our services showed remarkable resilience as macroeconomic uncertainties and geopolitical volatilities continued in major markets through the year.\\nThis growth came with an industry leading operating margin of \\n24.6%\\n2. More importantly we exited the year with a quarterly \\noperating margin of 26% in Q4,  demonstrating our commitment \\nto the margin band of 26% to 28%.

Although still in the early \\nstages of adoption, the use of GenAI is \\nexpected to transform every industry.Letter from the CEO  \\n8\\nIntegrated Annual Report 2023-24\\nIntegrated Annual Report 2023-24 Business Overview\\nEstablished in 1968, our company has been a pioneer in the IT industry, across various technology cycles. At each of these defining moments, we refocused our investments, reinvented ourselves, and helped clients transform their businesses to stay ahead of the technology curve.\\nDuring FY 2024, customers continued reprioritization of \\nprojects in favor of those which are considered business-critical and where ROI realization is likely faster. We continue to see pressure on customers’ discretionary spending. The recently won deals are converting into revenue as planned, the ongoing engagements started during the pandemic are being re-examined for the incremental value generated. While transformation remains a key ask, customers are expecting the same to be funded through savings from operations. Hence, the key engagement themes we saw during the year were  around cost optimization and cloud transformation.\\nDemand was led by vendor consolidation, cloud migration \\nand transformation, customer and employee experience enhancement, operating model transformation, business process optimization, supply chain initiatives, sustainability, AIenablement i.e. creating a cloud and data foundation for AI, and early-stage AI-infused transformational engagements.\\nToday, clients are seeing cloud as a strategy for business \\ntransformation and growth. The shift to cloud-native products and platforms is being fast-tracked, to achieve increased collaboration, security, scalability and efficiency. Hybrid,multi-cloud platforms are now becoming mainstream. Cloud adoption is a catalyst for innovation, and a strategy for business and growth itself. It provides the unifying digital fabric that forms the foundation for a connected future—onethat continues to unfold with each technological advancement, including generative AI (GenAI).The rise of GenAI has been catching customers’ attention, and it promises a leap in productivity and accelerates the creation of new products and services. Although still in the early stages of adoption, the use of GenAI is expected to transform every industry. Many of our clients who are early adopters have begun experimentation and exploration on various use cases of GenAI, with our help.\\nThe Innovation Edge\\nExploring innovative uses of GenAI continues to be a  key focus area. We are helping our customers to use AI to: (i) Assist, leveraging AI to supplement tacit knowledge with contextual knowledge to boost work effectiveness (ii) Augment, accelerating elite performance through collaborative intelligence, where humans and machines complement and magnify each other’s talents, and (iii) Transform, leaping to a knowledge-driven superstructure with fast, consistent, and high-quality decision output to deliver new ways of working and the full realization of enterprise-wide AI. We have created one of the largest AI / ML and GenAI talent pools in the industry. We have doubled down on partnerships in areas such as AI, cloud, quantum computing and cybersecurity. These early investments have given TCS a head start in being a partner in our customers’ technology adoption journey.\\nWith our contextual knowledge and domain expertise, \\nengineering DNA and intellectual capital, we have been the preferred partner for many customers in their strategicinitiatives. This year, we signed several deals that are industry- defining in nature. We have included narratives about the work we did for BSNL – building an indigenous network, a true nation building project and how we built an advanced post trading platform for SIX  in this Integrated Annual Report.\\nOur continued investments in Research and Innovation, and in building intellectual property, have further strengthened our transformational credentials. Many of our earlier R&I programs have matured into successful platforms and solutions which performed very well this year and helped differentiate our growth. We leveraged TCS HOBS\\nTM to transform Celcom Axiata \\nBerhad’s core business support systems. For PostNord, TCS TwinX\\nTM is helping increase sorter capacity, remove bottlenecks, \\nand improve the collection and distribution sort plan. Similarly, TCS Omnistore\\nTM is helping European home improvement \\ncompany Kingfisher orchestrate a faster, smoother, and seamless checkout experience.\\nBuilding a Skilled Workforce\\nOur approach to talent is strategic — we consider our employees as key stakeholders in our growth. Our ability to cycle through different technology and business model changes, continuously embrace new knowledge and stay relevant, defines us and gives us a significant edge over our competitors.\\nWe have a strength of 601,546  employees, and our LTM attrition \\nin IT services was 12.5%,  down by 760 bps over the previous \\nyear. Our workforce continued to be very diverse, with over 152  \\nnationalities represented and with women making up 35.6% of \\nthe employee base.We launched several initiatives this year to \\ninculcate a strong engineering culture among our employees and build deeper skills in market relevant technologies like Cloud, AI, Cyber Security and more. TCS is collaborating with all the hyperscalers and entering new partnerships with other important players in the AI ecosystem to upskill at scale and build AI computing infrastructure to develop AI solutions for our customers.\\nLetter from the CEO  \\n9\\nIntegrated Annual Report 2023-24 Best regards,\\nK KrithivasanChief Executive Officer and Managing Director\\nWe launched several initiatives this year to inculcate a \\nstrong engineering culture among our employees and build deeper skills in market relevant technologies like Cloud, AI, Cyber Security and more. TCS is collaborating with all thehyperscalers and entering new partnerships with otherimportant players in the AI ecosystem to upskill at scale and build AI computing infrastructure to develop AI solutions for our customers.\\nIn FY 2024, TCSers logged 51 million  learning hours, and \\nacquired nearly 5 million  competencies. A culture of lifelong \\nlearning and innovation, by closely linking learning with careers \\nand rewards, has placed us as the Global Top Employer for the 9th consecutive year, across 32 countries — placing us as one in only 16 organizations worldwide to achieve this status.\\nEmbracing Aalingana\\nWe have fully adopted  Project Aalingana, the Tata group’s sustainability roadmap and the aim is to be net zero by2045, integrating sustainability into business strategy and concentrating on three interlinked pillars of the project, i.e., promoting the decarbonization of our company and value chains; utilizing a systematic, circular economy approachto reduce resource usage and waste; and protecting and regenerating the environment.\\nWe continue to make good progress in our net zero journey, \\non the environmental front. TCS had set a target to reduce its absolute Scope 1 and Scope 2 emissions by 70% by 2025 andbecome net zero by 2030. We are well ahead of our initial Scope 1 and 2 targets and have achieved a reduction of 80% in Scope 1 and 2 emissions in FY 2024 over a baseline of 2016. We are doing this by increasing use of renewable sources of energy and improving energy efficiency.\\nThe company’s strategy for reducing emissions includes addition \\nof more green buildings to the company’s real estate portfolio, reduction of IT system power usage, responsible sourcing, and the use of TCS Clever Energy\\nTM, which leverages IoT, machine \\nlearning and AI to optimize energy consumption across campuses.\\nTCS is not only improving its own sustainability but also helping \\nclients develop and implement their sustainability strategies and improve outcomes. We have built a comprehensive suite of over 200 offerings in sustainability services and solutions across different industry verticals. These solutions help enterprises decarbonize their operations and create net-zero pathways, addressing biodiversity loss and growing inequity. We help customers embed circularity in their products and services, by helping design agile, resilient, and sustainable supply chains and promoting reuse, recapture, and recycling.\\nPassion for Our Purpose\\nTCS is meaningfully connecting marginalized groups, including women and youth, to economic opportunities. We continue to work with communities across the world, pursuing our long-standing commitment to programs in the areas of education, literacy for livelihood, skilling for employment, and digital entrepreneurship; while exploring areas of healthcare, digital inclusion, water, climate and sustainability.Through clearly defined focus areas and strategic programs, our work has impacted the lives of over 7.1 million people.  We are \\nworking with public and social sector organizations to help close the literacy gap among the most marginalized adults, helping them access government entitlements and improving access to livelihood. We are empowering students in government schools with 21st century skills, introducing them to careers of the future, while empowering and building capacity of the teachers and education system.\\nBy working with other private sector organizations, we are \\nhelping marginalized youth transition from college to meaningful careers across a variety of sectors. Our digital entrepreneurs are connecting disadvantaged communities in rural and aspirational districts across India with front line services in social welfare, banking, finance, insurance, health, e-commerce, logistics and more.\\nOur employee volunteer program called HOPE (Hours of \\nPurpose by Employees) resulted in over 6.7 million hours \\ndedicated to purpose projects across dimensions of biodiversity, mental health, climate action, circularity, literacy, education, skilling, mentoring, conservation and more covering the 17 UN Sustainable Development Goals.\\nGreater Governance\\nGovernance at TCS encompasses ensuring ethical and transparent business conduct, addressing sustainability risks and opportunities and aligning robust disclosure requirements under the aegis of the board. At TCS, the Tata Code of Conduct serves as a guide for all employee behavior.\\nTCS consciously embeds the highest standards of governance \\nin its operations. We have a holistic compliance framework and an integrated governance structure that encourages a strong commitment to global Environment, Social and Governance (ESG) disclosure standards for promoting transparency and accountability. As part of the Tata Group, we have longrecognized the ESG stewardship as core to our purpose. We have a proud legacy of pioneering positive change, not just within the industry but in the communities where we operate as well, and our commitment remains steadfast.\\nLooking Ahead\\nOur all-time high order book, continued deal flow and pipeline velocity give us confidence in our business momentum. Looking forward, we see greater opportunities ahead, as businesses become more technology-intensive and depend on technology to drive competitive differentiation and transform their industries. Our integrated business model which drives value creation for all our stakeholders, will continue to help us benefit from each new wave of technology change, and be a force multiplier for our growth and leadership in years to come.

Built by TCS, SECOM was one of the world’s first real-time gross settlement (RTGS) systems and formed the backbone of the Swiss capital market. But can a three-decade old system meet the strenuous demands of modern times? TCS and SIX both knew the answer was ‘no’. SIX decided to embark on a journey of transformation yet again, backed by three decades of relation and trust it shares with TCS. \\nBack in 1990, when SIX was looking to enhance the scalability \\nof its batch system to meet the market demands of the future, TCS proposed a new platform called SECOM. This platform would be real time, cutting-edge, scalable, and modular with robust architecture. Enabling straight-through processing, it was amongst the most sophisticated systems of its time. Over the years, TCS continued to manage this system for SIX.\\nThree decades later, SIX partnered with TCS to accomplish \\nanother mega feat. TCS executed a PoC to demonstrate the CUSTOMER\\nSTORIES\\nTrading old for new: SIX unveils an \\nadvanced post trading platform\\nTo take this forward, TCS tapped into its design labs to create \\na platform that reimagined the user experience and enabled faster response to queries. TCS was able to fast-track this development with an ingenious automation solution which migrated over 500 billion records in record time, saving 10-12 months’ time from the overall process.\\nThe flexible, secure, and cloud-ready platform is economical \\nand makes SIX’ internal operations and process more efficient. The ability to customize individual post trade processes depending on market requirements in different parts of the world has set SIX on a steady path of growth and expansion. With this new and advanced system, SIX became more modern, up to date and market-friendly – boosting customer-centricity and overall competitiveness – and maintaining its pole position in the Swiss financial market.    \\nfeasibility of modernizing the existing system. TCS showed \\nhow this transformation would serve SIX for decades to come – making it more efficient, enabling speed and growth for the firm. Placing trust in TCS’ execution capabilities, SIX decided to go ahead with the transformation. Thus, the next journey from mainframe to an open and more resilient system began. This is going to give a second life to our core \\nCSD platform and make our relationship with \\nTCS even stronger. We are conscious of the pressure \\nand high expectations that we have put on TCS for the most \\ncomplex project in recent years, but the TCS team has lived up to the expectations with an outstanding level of commitment.

Organizations across utilities, retail and banking are not aware or not able to cater to their support needs effectively, providing the company an opportunity to get closer to its customer and deliver more accessible products and services. Shaping a future of accessibility and financial inclusion   \\nWith TCS as a partner, Experian developed the Support Hub to help vulnerable people get easier access to essential services like banking, utilities, telecom and retail. For the first time, consumers can disclose their support needs to multiple organizations at the same time and have complete control over their data with an intuitive and accessible UX designed exclusively for them.  \\nLeveraging the TCS Pace\\nTM and TCS Accessibility Centre \\nof Excellence from design to testing,  Support Hub is \\ninstrumental in improving Experian’s user engagement. The Experian Support Hub allows people to share their support needs with multiple service providers in a simple, standardized way. For instance, the end customer can now define their needs like requesting statements in Braille or getting longer appointments or more support when visiting a branch.  \\nThrough this unique initiative, Experian has been able to \\nexpand its partner ecosystem which will help them enter new markets and make a pivotal advancement in fostering financial inclusion. By 2030, Experian aims to help seven million consumers connect with over 200 organizations. TCS has been a critical partner of Experian in this initiative from day 1, working closely with the Support Hub team to structure our requirements and design an intuitive, accessible solution that could be deployed quickly.

The contract involves the following key dimensions:\\n• Establishing modern cloud native data centers with geographical redundancies for each of the four zones and about 30+ edge data centers closer to the clients.\\nIn response to the Government of India’s ‘Atmanirbhar \\nBharat’  call, TCS collaborated with Centre for Development \\nof Telematics (C-DOT) and Tejas Networks Limited (Tejas) to design and develop an indigenous telecom stack. This complex initiative was undertaken with significant efforts to design the equipment, establish a lab and testing infrastructure of scale besides building the entire manufacturing ecosystem in India. The resultant solution of EPC Core, RAN, IMS, and the cognitive NMS was proven by integrating it in the state-owned Bharat Sanchar Nigam Limited’s (BSNL) existing network through a well-structured proof of concept. The indigenously designed equipment are programmable and the overall network will be ‘Software Defined’ and highly configurable. With this, India became only the fifth country in the world to have developed this complex technology end to end.• Deploying the EPC Core and IMS software supplied by C-DOT integrating it with the existing BSNL landscape in a high scalable cloud architecture along with TCS’ Cognitive Network Operations (CNOPS) to efficiently manage and configure the network.\\n• Install, commission, and optimize the Radios (RAN) meeting the specifications of BSNL and global standards, supplied by Tejas.\\n• Extend Operations and Maintenance support to the network on an on-going basis.\\nThis project is governed as a ‘mission-mode’ project by TCS, BSNL and the Department of Telecommunications. As of April 2024, TCS has delivered 11,000 sites and are well on its way to complete the roll-out by end of this year. BSNL has already added to the scope another 22,000 sites to further densify the coverage and to include ‘saturation’ sites. This is to ensure digital inclusivity to rural and remote areas of India.\\nThis is a historic and significant leap towards bridging the \\ndigital divide, ushering in the benefits of a powerful voice and data network to all corners of the country. With this, TCS along with its partners is enabling BSNL to enhance its competitiveness, increase revenues, offer a compelling enterprise proposition, and explore new business opportunities. \\nCustomer Stories  \\n28\\nIntegrated Annual Report 2023-24 CUSTOMER\\nSTORIES\\nWhat happens when two companies with a shared vision join \\nforces?

The global GDP is estimated to have grown at 3.2% in CY 2023, lower than 3.5% in CY 2022\\n1, led by fears of a hard recession. Yet, despite \\nmany gloomy predictions, the world avoided a recession, the banking system proved largely resilient, and major emerging market economies did not suffer sudden stops. Economic growth has been stronger than expected in the second half of 2023 in the United States, and several major emerging market and developing economies. However, the rising momentum was not felt everywhere, with notably subdued growth in the euro area, reflecting weak consumer sentiment, the lingering effects of high energy prices, and weakness in interest-rate-sensitive sectors.\\nUnmet revenue expectations have ushered in a new wave of \\npragmatism where maintaining a healthy profit margin has become pivotal for corporations due to the uncertain macro-outlook. In extreme cases, organizations resorted to cost-cutting measures, such as reducing headcount and cutting discretionary spending, including IT services. Organizations taking a more rational approach are simply shifting the emphasis of ongoing IT projects toward cost control, efficiencies and automation while curtailing IT initiatives with longer RoIs. Global technology spending on Enterprise software and IT services was close to the US$2.3 trillion\\n2 mark in CY 2023, with IT services growing at 6.1% \\nYoY to US$1.4 trillion. \\nThe global IT services industry continues to be a highly \\nfragmented one, with even the largest provider having a mid-single digit market share. TCS is among the largest IT services providers globally, with a market share of 2.1%. TCS’ outperformance is significantly higher over the last decade. The outperformance may be attributed to market share gains resulting from TCS’ strategy on customer centricity, its agile organization structure, and a very stable leadership team; its investments in organic talent development, research and innovation, intellectual property, brand building, and in building newer capabilities that have helped expand wallet share with clients; and better execution resulting in greater customer satisfaction. \\nTCS’ Business\\nAn Overview\\nTCS is an IT services, consulting and business solutions \\norganization partnering many of the world’s largest businesses in their transformational journeys for the last 56 years. It has a global presence, deep domain expertise in multiple industry verticals and a complete portfolio of offerings – grouped under consulting and service integration, application services, digital transformation services, AI and cloud services, engineering services, cognitive business operations, and products and platforms – targeting every C-suite stakeholder. \\nThe company leverages all these capabilities and its profound \\ncontextual knowledge of its customers’ businesses to create bespoke, high quality, high impact solutions designed to deliver \\nGlobal Spend on IT Services (US$ Bn)\\nTCS Revenue (US$ Bn)\\nFY 2014 FY 20242.2x1.5xUS$ Billion\\n13.49261,385\\n29.1\\nIntegrated Annual Report 2023-24 70 Management Discussion and Analysis\\n3 GRI 2-22 \\n4  Ref AR FY 2012, MD&A, Pages 25, 29  \\n5  Ref AR FY 2010, Letter from CEO, Page 7differentiated business outcomes. These solutions are delivered \\nusing its operating model which enables a highly distributed, Location Independent Agile™ delivery.\\nTCS geographic footprint covers North America, Latin America, \\nthe United Kingdom, Continental Europe, Asia Pacific, India and Middle-East Africa.\\nTCS considers industry verticals as its primary go-to-market \\nbusiness segments. The five key vertical clusters are: Banking, Financial Services and Insurance (BFSI), Communication, Media and Technology (CMT), Consumer Business, Life Sciences and Healthcare, Manufacturing and Others such as Energy, Resources and Utilities, Public Services and Products.\\nStrategy for Sustainable Growth\\n3\\nTCS has successfully navigated through multiple technology \\ncycles since its inception, transforming and adapting each time to build relevant new capabilities and helping its clients realize the benefits of that innovative technology. TCS’ responsiveness, agility and adaptability to change have been core to its longevity.\\nCustomer-centricity is at the heart of TCS’ strategy, organization \\nstructure and investment decisions. TCS has been broadening and deepening customer relationships by continually looking for new opportunities and newer areas in their businesses to add value, proactively investing in building capabilities, reskilling its workforce, and launching innovative services, solutions, products, and platforms to address those opportunities. \\nTCS is reinventing itself at a time of unprecedented change in \\nthe IT Services industry. Digital, AI and Cloud technologies are now business enablers, and core to the success of business, fueling the need for enterprise-wide transformation and continuous innovation. \\nTechnology disruption is blurring traditional industry lines, \\nmaking cross-industry expertise an imperative. Adaptation is the key to survival. TCS believes in the power of inspiration \\nand invention to build greater futures and help in transforming industries. The company’s research and innovation team apply scientific rigor and a collaborative mindset to solve pressing problems faced by industries and society. \\nOver time, this strategy has resulted in deep and enduring \\ncustomer relationships, a vibrant and engaged workforce, industry-leading profitability, a steady expansion of the addressable market, and a proven record of accomplishment in delivering longer term stakeholder value. \\nEnabling Investments\\nTCS has been at the forefront of every technology adoption cycle over the past several decades. The company has anticipated every technology change and invested in innovation, talent, intellectual property, and partnerships well in advance. TCS pioneered\\n4 the ‘Default is Digital’ approach to leverage the \\nnew family of technologies that emerged in the last decade. TCS was early to identify that decision making in enterprises would increase in complexity and would require novel uses of digital technologies. Its research into Enterprise Digital Twins enables it to simulate enterprises in hi-fidelity and use AI for decision making. Backed by 10 years of research (started in 2013) and over 40 publications in top-tier journals, TCS launched an Enterprise Digital Twin product offering called TCS TwinX™. The multiple award-winning product today simulates enterprise decision making for several TCS customers.\\nQuick to recognize the potential of cloud, the company made \\ninvestments ahead of time in launching new platform-based business models as far back as in 2009\\n5, reskilling the workforce, \\nresearch and innovation, building collaborative workspaces and innovation centers, intellectual property, and alliances and partnerships. TCS created a separate research group focused on ‘Deep Learning and AI’ in 2017 and identified ‘AI’ as a critical skill that every researcher should acquire. TCS has doubled down on partnerships in areas such as AI, Quantum Computing and Cybersecurity. These early investments have given TCS a head- start in being a partner in its customers’ technology adoption lifecycles. \\nThe exploration of innovative uses of GenAI has been a \\nfocal point for TCS Research this year. More details on TCS R&I investments during the year are available on Page 61 of Directors’ Report in the section on ‘Technology absorption, \\nadoption and innovation’ . \\nTCS’ dedication to innovation is evident with its dynamic intellectual property (IP) portfolio, which saw continual enhancement through the filing and granting of patents and the publication of research papers. TCS’ IP portfolio has grown by a CAGR of over 13% over the past decade. TCS is the largest patent \\nfiler in the industry category in India and has been honored with 42 IP awards  in the last 10 years, including winning the National \\nIP Award 4 times in the last 7 years. \\nTCS’ dedicated practice units around major hyperscalers have \\nbeen steadily investing in training, certifications, credentials and in building solutions and intellectual property on their respective hyperscaler stacks. AI.Cloud Academy was launched to bring together initiatives from all Cloud and AI partners, and  to drive talent transformation at scale with a theme “Making AI REAL” for TCS’ customers. As on 31st March 2024, TCS had one of the world’s largest AI/ML and GenAI trained workforce. AI Experience Zone, TCS’s indigenous, multi-platform AI playground continues to develop employees with higher competencies in GenAI through Industry specific use cases integrated into programs and hackathons. One of the significant investments has been in building a multi modal, hyperscaler agnostic, domain catalogue enabled, pattern driven, multi orchestrator GenAI platform called TCS AI WisdomNext to help customers accelerate their GenAI journey.\\nIn addition to the hyperscalers, TCS has also invested in building \\nkey partnerships with other major cloud and AI ecosystem partners, to bring best of GenAI offerings to TCS’ customers. TCS has invested in deep dive technical training along with hands-on sessions to help upskill existing employees thereby empowering \\nIntegrated Annual Report 2023-24 71 Management Discussion and Analysis\\nthem to leverage technology as part of ongoing delivery. TCS has launched AI Academy and the AI Experience Zone platform for \\nexperiential AI/ML and GenAI talent development.  TCS has launched several PoVs on how the industry value chains including personas involved can be transformed using the power of GenAI.  TCS also has significantly invested in onboarding 150+ horizontal and vertical solutions on hyperscaler platforms in a cloud native manner augmented with GenAI capabilities.  \\nAs TCS transforms industries, building momentum requires continuous perseverance, flawless execution against the company’s \\nstrategic priorities: Customer Centricity and Employee Empathy.\\nTCS’ Strategic Responses to Opportunities and Threats\\nOpportunity / Threat TCS Approach Outcomes\\nMacroeconomic uncertainty and geopolitical volatility impacting decision making and prompting  an increased mix of cost optimization and cloud transformation- led deals and reduced discretionary spend•\\n Pr\\noven track record in helping enterprises reduce their \\ncost of operations.\\n• Pr\\noactive pitching of IT and business operating model \\ntransformations that deliver greater efficiency, enhance enterprise agility, resilience and better output.\\n•\\n Lev\\neraging full services capability and deep client \\nrelationships to propose product-aligned operating models. \\n•\\n Use of TCS Cognix™ t\\no accelerate operations \\ntransformation, using over 600 pre-built automation components that infuse AI/ML and other technologies into IT and business processes to reduce human intervention, increase velocity and productivity.•\\n Strong deal flo\\nw resulting in a robust \\norder book that gives better visibility of medium to long-term growth.\\n•\\n Marke\\nt share gains in vendor \\nconsolidation led deals.\\n• Efficiency g\\nains helping fund client’s \\ntransformation programs in some instances. \\n•\\n TCS Cognix r\\necognized as a means of \\ndriving quicker realization of RoI.\\nGreater interest in using technology to drive business growth and differentiation•\\n Focused on de\\nveloping contextual knowledge and \\napplying that for inside-out transformations.\\n• Continued in\\nvestments in research and innovation, TCS \\nPace Ports, and intellectual property.\\n• Dedica\\nted practice with domain experts to bring \\ntogether TCS’ differentiated capabilities from across the organization to stitch together comprehensive solutions.\\n•\\n Pr\\noactive pitching of solutions to customers’ most \\npressing business problems.\\n• Re\\nfocused on industry expertise, as well as technology \\nand service lines, increased investment in regional markets to diversify portfolio.\\n•\\n Nation building pr\\nograms which add to capabilities and \\ncredentials.\\n• Deepened partner ecos\\nystem for joint go-to-market \\nstrategy.• Expansion of addressable mark\\net.\\n• Higher quality re\\nvenue, lending margin \\nresilience.\\n• More deeply embedded in the clien\\nt’s \\nbusiness.\\n• Engaging with a br\\noader set of buyers in \\nthe client organization.\\n• Higher visibility within C-Suites.\\nIntegrated Annual Report 2023-24 72 Management Discussion and Analysis\\nOpportunity / Threat TCS Approach Outcomes\\nStrategic technology \\ninvestments•  Set up the AI.\\nCloud  unit bringing both Cloud and AI \\ncapabilities together to drive transformations for the customer under a ‘Responsible AI’  framework; invested \\nin Intrapreneurial teams to discover the art of the \\npossible.\\n•\\n Continued in\\nvestment in skill building, certifications, \\ncredentials, IP and accelerators.\\n• Made av\\nailable TCS products and solutions on public \\nclouds.• Strong gr\\nowth in cloud migration and \\ntransformation revenues. \\n• Working on 250+ P\\noCs and PoVs in \\nAssist and Augment use cases, few programs moving into production.\\n•\\n Top tier partner t\\no each of the \\nhyperscalers.\\n• Pr\\neferred partner to clients seeking to \\nuse cloud native capabilities to power their business transformation.\\n•\\n Over half of the w\\norkforce trained in AI/\\nML and GenAI technologies.\\nGreater acceptance of as-a-Service platforms •\\n Streng\\nthened alliances and launched new offerings \\naround the popular and new SaaS products.\\n• Helped ISV* clien\\nts upgrade their products to launch \\nnew SaaS versions.\\n• Partnering with pr\\noduct manufacturers to help launch \\ninnovative as-a-Service offerings using TCS Bring Life to Things IoT framework. \\nTCS IP:\\n•\\n Pr\\nomoted SaaS versions of in-house product portfolio, \\nnow available on hyperscaler platforms.\\n• Used IP portfolio t\\no launch new platforms that bundle IP \\nand shared services on the cloud.• Outperformance and diff\\nerentiated \\ngrowth compared to peers.\\n• Strong\\ner win-win partnerships.\\n• Expansion of addressable mark\\net.\\n• Strong gr\\nowth in SaaS sales.\\n• Platf\\norms drive stickier relationships, \\nwith long term revenue visibility.\\n* Independent Software VendorTalent Management\\nTCS is a talent and innovation led organization that aims to attract, develop, motivate, and retain diverse talent, which is critical for its competitive differentiation and continued success.

The financial statements of Tata Consultancy Services Limited and its subsidiaries (collectively referred to as ‘TCS’ or ‘the Company’) are prepared in accordance with the Indian Accounting Standards (referred to as `Ind AS’) prescribed under section 133 of the Companies Act, 2013, read with the Companies (Indian Accounting Standards) Rules, as amended from time to time. Significant accounting policies used in the preparation of the financial statements are disclosed in the notes to the consolidated financial statements.\\nThe following table gives an overview of the consolidated financial results of the company:\\n(` crore)\\nFY 2024* FY 2024 FY 2023 \\nAmount % of \\nRevenue% Growth Amount % of \\nRevenueAmount % of \\nRevenue\\nRevenue from operations 240,893 100.0 6.8 240,893 100.0 225,458 100.0\\nEarnings before interest and tax \\n(EBIT) (Before other income)59,311 24.6 9.4 58,353 24.2 54,237 24.1\\nProfit after tax attributable to shareholders of the company46,585 19.3 10.5 45,908 19.1 42,147 18.7\\nEarnings per share (in ₹) 127.74 10.9 125.88 115.19\\nAnalysis of revenue growth and margin performanceOn a reported basis, TCS’ revenue grew 6.8% in FY 2024, compared to 17.6% in the prior year. The company’s performance showed a remarkable resilience against the backdrop of macro uncertainty and geo-political volatility. Demand for TCS’ services, particularly around cloud adoption, cost optimization, vendor consolidation and operating model transformation, resulted in record deal wins. The newly won deals conversion into revenue continued as expected, but the revenue inflows kept getting neutralized by reduction in the existing revenue base as some of the earlier projects got completed, optimized, or in some cases, downsized. This led to overall muted revenue growth in FY 2024. \\nEBIT margins were 24.6%* in FY 2024, compared to 24.1% in the previous year. Margin improvement was led by improved productivity, \\nbetter utilization and reduction in subcontractor expenses.\\nAverage currency exchange rates during FY 2024 for the three major currencies are given below:\\nCurrency Weightage (%) FY 2024\\n`FY 2023\\n`% Change YoY\\nUSD 53.3 82.83 80.74 2.6\\nGBP 14.4 104.07 96.98 7.3\\nEUR 11.1 89.80 84.01 6.9\\nMovements in currency exchange rates through the year resulted in a positive impact of 3.4% on the reported revenue.

With disinflation \\nand steady growth, the likelihood of a hard landing seems to have receded, and risks to global growth seem broadly balanced. \\nThe uncertainty seen through last year is expected to persist \\nfor the next few quarters. Capex investments are projected to remain subdued as enterprises focus on maximizing returns from existing investments, resulting in muted spending on infrastructure, software, and services. Cessation of hostilities and successful control of inflation can be the triggers for recovery which will stimulate global demand. This, in turn, should prompt customers to resume spending on discretionary products and services.\\nDespite challenges, spending on IT services has been resilient so far. \\nCloud technologies have become the mainstay of an enterprise’s agenda and key to achieving sustainable growth. As a unifying digital hub that brings multiple other technologies to life, cloud has accelerated digital and business transformation over the last fiscal. The higher level of uncertainty in the business environment has made clients more receptive to proactive proposals around IT and business operating model transformations that can not only deliver significant efficiencies but also help them become more agile and resilient. All this has resulted in a record order book for FY 2024, at US$42.7 billion. Global IT Spending is expected to increase 8% in 2024\\n9, with enterprises emphasizing on organizational efficiency \\nand optimization. \\nLast year saw GenAI seemingly at the heart of every strategic \\ndiscussion. Fueled by cloud, this combination of AI capabilities is creating new possibilities and new opportunities. Firms will continue to invest heavily in technology to enhance efficiency, security, and customer experience. Rise in spend is expected in cloud computing, ecosystem play and GenAI leading to better resilience and new customer value creation. Cybersecurity will remain a top priority, driving demand for advanced threat detection and prevention solutions. \\nAll the above factors provide growth visibility over the medium \\nto long term amid near-term uncertainty. If the delayed decision-making and cash conservation seen in some segments through FY 2024 continues into the next fiscal year, it could lead to a moderation in growth in FY 2025.\\nKey demand drivers expected to power the company’s growth in \\nFY 2025 include:\\n•\\n Technology tr\\nansformation:  IT infrastructure \\nmodernization, cloud enablement, application and data \\nestate modernization, cloud migration and transformation; data centre and collocated data support; SaaS adoption; digital workplace; digital twins; cyber security; ERP modernization; low-code no-code; 5G/Edge and AI adoption. \\n•\\n Business Tr\\nansformation:  Customer experience \\ntransformation using personalization, omnichannel implementation, immersive experiences using XR/Metaverse; product and business model innovation; supply chain modernization; M&A integration / divestitures; sustainability, new business model enablement, by harnessing GenAI.\\n•\\n Opera\\ntions:  Plain vanilla outsourcing, vendor consolidation \\nand multi-services deals; AI/ML-led transformation of IT / business operations for greater resilience and leaner operating models; managed services models and real time operation visibility. \\nIntegrated Annual Report 2023-24 79 Management Discussion and Analysis\\n10  GRI 3-3  \\n11  GRI 201-2Enterprise Risk Management\\nTCS understands the importance of effectively managing and mitigating risks to protect the company’s business, its clients, to add value for all its stakeholders, and ensuring that the company’s reputation is intact.\\nThe company follows a comprehensive enterprise risk \\nmanagement framework (based on best practices from COSO 2017 and ISO 31000:2018) that encompasses risk identification, risk assessment, risk response planning and actions, risk monitoring and overall risk governance. Fostering a risk aware culture and empowering leaders to take intelligent risks to maximize value are crucial. TCS regularly conducts risk reviews, assessments, and scenario planning to anticipate potential challenges and develop mitigation plans. Key risk indicators and control indicators are used to assess risks, provide early warnings, and consider effectiveness of the mitigation actions, respectively. Furthermore, the company engages with all stakeholders, including customers, employees, suppliers, partners and regulatory authorities, to ensure transparent and collaborative risk management practices.\\nTCS takes a holistic view of its enterprise risk profile, covering \\nstrategic, operational, compliance, financial and catastrophic risks, thus enabling informed decision-making.  Risks are assessed and managed at various levels with a top-down and bottom-up approach across the enterprise, business units, geographies, business functions, customer relationships and individual projects.\\nBy proactively managing and mitigating these risks, the \\ncompany’s aim is to ensure the long-term sustainability and success of the company.

This framework of internal financial controls meets the requirement of the Companies Act 2013. The Internal Control – Integrated Framework (the 2013 framework) is intended to increase transparency and accountability in an organization’s process of designing and implementing a system of internal control. The framework requires a company to identify and analyze risks and manage appropriate responses. The company has successfully laid down the framework and ensured its effectiveness. \\nTCS’ internal controls are commensurate with its size and the \\nnature of its operations. These have been designed to provide reasonable assurance with regard to recording and providing reliable financial and operational information, complying with applicable statutes, safeguarding assets from unauthorized use, executing transactions with proper authorization and ensuring compliance with corporate policies. TCS has a well-defined delegation of power with authority limits commensurate with the responsibilities for approving engagements with all stakeholders that commits organizational resources and results in creation of assets and liabilities, income and expenditure. TCS uses a state-of-the-art enterprise resource planning (ERP) system that connects all parts of the organization, to record data for accounting, consolidation and management information purposes. It has continued its efforts to align all its processes and controls with global best practices.\\nTCS management assessed the effectiveness of the company’s \\ninternal control over financial reporting (as defined in Regulation 17 of SEBI LODR Regulations 2015) as of March 31, 2024. B S R & Co. LLP , the statutory auditors of TCS, have audited the financial statements included in this annual report and have issued an attestation report on the company’s internal control over financial reporting (as defined in section 143 of Companies Act 2013).\\nTCS has appointed PricewaterhouseCoopers Services LLP to \\noversee and carry out an internal audit of its activities. Design and operating effectiveness of process controls on financial transactions is also audited by an independent in-house internal audit team.  The audit is based on an internal audit plan, which is reviewed each year in consultation with the statutory auditors and approved by the audit committee. In line with international practice, the conduct of internal audit is oriented towards the review of internal controls and risks in the company’s operations such as software delivery, accounting and finance, procurement, employee engagement, travel, insurance, IT processes, including the subsidiaries and foreign branches.\\nTCS also undergoes periodic audit by specialized third party \\nconsultants and professionals for business specific compliances such as quality management, service management, information security, etc. The audit committee reviews reports submitted by the management and audit reports submitted by internal auditors and statutory auditors. Suggestions for improvement are considered and the audit committee follows up on corrective action. The audit committee also meets TCS’ statutory auditors to ascertain, inter alia, their views on the adequacy of internal control systems and keeps the board of directors informed of its major observations periodically.\\nBased on its evaluation (as defined in section 177 of Companies \\nAct 2013 and Regulation 18 of SEBI LODR Regulations 2015), TCS’ audit committee has concluded that, as of March 31, 2024, the company’s internal financial controls were adequate and operating effectively.\\nIntegrated Annual Report 2023-24 89 Management Discussion and Analysis\\nPerformance Trend – 10 years \\n(` Crore)\\n Ind AS  Indian GAAP \\nFY 2024* FY 2024 FY 2023 FY 2022 FY 2021* FY 2021 FY 2020 FY 2019 FY 2018 FY 2017 FY 2016 FY 2015#FY 2015\\nRevenue from operations              \\nTot\\nal revenue from \\noperations240,893 240,893 225,458 191,754 164,177 164,177 156,949 146,463 123,104 117,966 108,646 94,648 94,648\\nRevenue by geographic \\nsegments             \\nAmericas 127,939\\n127,939 124,336 100,072 84,278 84,278 82,000 77,562 66,145 66,091 60,011 51,053 51,053\\nEurope 75,624 75,624 67,436 61,142 52,346 52,346 48,037 43,456 34,155 30,038 29,092 26,730 26,730\\nIndia 13,562 13,562 11,271 9,805 8,449 8,449 8,964 8,393 7,921 7,415 6,729 6,108 6,108\\nOthers 23,768 23,768 22,415 20,735 19,104 19,104 17,948 17,052 14,883 14,422 12,814 10,757 10,757\\nCost              \\nEmploy\\nee cost 140,131 140,131 127,522 107,554 91,814 91,814 85,952 78,246 66,396 61,621 55,348 48,296 50,924\\nOther operating cost 36,466 37,424 38,677 31,143 25,817 27,035 28,888 28,711 24,192 24,034 22,621 19,242 19,242\\nTotal cost (excluding interest & depreciation)176,597 177,555 166,199 138,697 117,631 118,849 114,840 106,957 90,588 85,655 77,969 67,538 70,166\\nProfitability\\n             \\nEBIT 59,311 58,353 54,237 48,453 42,481 41,263 38,580 37,450 30,502 30,324 28,789 25,311 22,683\\nPr\\nofit before tax 63,038 61,997 56,907 51,687 44,978 43,760 42,248 41,563 34,092 34,513 31,840 28,437 25,809\\nProfit after tax attributable to shareholders of the Company46,585 45,908 42,147 38,327 33,388 32,430 32,340 31,472 25,826 26,289 24,270 21,912 19,852\\nFinancial Position\\n             \\nEquity shar\\ne capital 362 362 366 366 370 370 375 375 191 197 197 196 196\\nReserves and surplus 90,805 90,127 90,058 88,773 87,014 86,063 83,751 89,071 84,937 86,017 70,875 52,499 50,439\\nGross block of property, plant and equipment33,853 33,853 32,344 30,300 28,658 28,658 26,444 24,522 22,720 20,891 19,308 16,624 16,624\\nTotal investments 31,762 31,762 37,163 30,485 29,373 29,373 26,356 29,330 36,008 41,980 22,822 1,662 1,662\\nNet current assets 67,558 66,880 66,712 65,959 66,076 65,125 63,177 70,047 63,396 65,804 47,644 30,726 28,495\\nEarnings per share in `\\n             \\nEPS -

Company ’s Philosophy on Corporate Governance\\n  Eff\\nective corporate governance practices constitute \\nthe strong foundation on which successful commercial \\nenterprises are built to last. The Company’s philosophy on corporate governance oversees business strategies and ensures fiscal accountability, ethical corporate behaviour and fairness to all stakeholders comprising employees, investors, customers, regulators, suppliers and the society at large. Strong leadership and effective corporate governance practices have been the Company’s hallmark inherited from the Tata culture and ethos.\\n \\n The Company f\\nollows the Tata Group philosophy of building \\nsustainable businesses that are rooted in the community and demonstrate care for the environment. Being a part of the Tata Group, which epitomizes sustainability, the Company has inherited a strong legacy of fair and transparent ethical governance, as embodied in the Tata\\n Code of Conduct (“\\nTCoC”).\\n  The Company has adop\\nted the TCoC for its employees \\nincluding the Chief Executive Officer and Managing Director and the Executive Directors. In addition, the Company has adopted a Code of Conduct for its non-executive directors which includes Code of Conduct for Independent Directors that suitably incorporates the duties of independent directors as laid down in the Companies Act, 2013 (“the\\n Act\\n”).\\n  The Company\\n’s corporate governance philosophy has been \\nfurther strengthened through the Tata Business Excellence Model, the TCS Code of Conduct for Prevention of Insider Trading and the Code of Corporate Disclosure Practices (“Insider Trading Code”). The Company has in place an Information Security Policy that ensures proper utilization of IT resources.\\n \\n The Company is in c\\nompliance with the requirements \\nstipulated under Regulations 17 to 27 read with Schedule V and clauses (b) to (i) and (t) of sub-regulation (2) of Regulation 46 of Securities and Exchange Board of India (Listing Obligations and Disclosure Requirements) Regulations, 2015 (“SEBI Listing Regulations”), as applicable, with regard to corporate governance.\\n \\n The det\\nails of TCS’ board structure and the various \\ncommittees that constitute the governance structure1 of \\nthe organization are covered in detail in this report.\\n  The various ma\\nterial aspects of corporate governance and \\nTCS’ approach to them are discussed in the table below:Corporate Governance Report\\nMaterial Topic TCS’ Approach\\nBoard effectiveness, independence and protection of minority Shareholders’ interestsBoard effectiveness is enhanced by setting a high bar in selecting the right mix of individuals to serve on the Board, with the right qualifications, expertise and experience, who can collectively serve the best interests of all stakeholders, maintain board and management accountability and drive corporate ethics, values and sustainability. Profiles of Board of Directors are available at https://www.tcs.com/who-we-are/leadership .\\nFor greater diversity of opinions and perspectives within the Board, the Nomination and Remuneration Committee\\n2 has fostered diversity in terms of backgrounds, areas of expertise \\nand:\\n1 GRI 2-9\\n2 GRI 2-10\\n Integrated Annual Report 2023-2494 Corporate  Governanc e R eport  \\nMaterial Topic TCS’ Approach\\n• Gender: Tw o (22.2 percent) of the nine Directors are women.\\n•  Nati\\nonality: Four nationalities represented – Indian, American, Danish and British.\\n•  Indus\\ntry: Technology, Banking, Energy, Transportation and Academia.\\nTCS’ policy on Appointment of Directors and Board Diversity can be found at https://on.tcs.\\ncom/appointment-BoD. \\nBoard independence is ensured by having an independent majority, with 5 independent \\ndirectors out of 9 i.e., 55.6 percent. None of the Independent Directors is related to each other, or to the non-independent directors. Average tenure of independent directors is 6 years.\\nBoard effectiveness is further improved by ensuring that none of the directors holds \\ndirectorships in more than seven listed entities, and none of the executive directors serves as an independent director on the Boards of more than three listed entities.\\nTCS’ governance philosophy around minority Shareholders’ interests is guided by the TCoC \\nwhich emphasizes fairness and transparency to all stakeholders. Further a qualified, diverse and independent Board ensures that minority shareholders’ interests are protected.\\nTCS strives to reduce information asymmetry through transparency, extensive disclosures \\nand detailed commentary of the demand environment and the state of the business, and material developments. The Company provides a variety of channels including a structured global investor outreach program, through which minority shareholders can interact with the management or the Board.\\nShareholders can communicate concerns and grievances to the Company Secretary’s office \\nthrough a well-publicized channel, where complaints are tracked till closure. The Stakeholders’ Relationship Committee oversees the redressal of these complaints.\\nAvoidance of conflict of interest\\n3Chairmanship4 of the Board is a non-executive position, and separate from that of the \\nChief  Ex\\necutive Officer and Managing Director (“CEO & MD”).\\nTCoC5 for non-executive directors, and for independent directors, carries explicit clauses \\ncovering avoidance of conflict of interest. Likewise, it explicitly prohibits any employee, including the executive directors, from accepting any position of responsibility, with or without remuneration, with any other organization without TCS’ prior written approval. For the executive directors, such approval must be obtained from the Board.\\nValues, Ethics and compliance\\n6Over the last five decades, TCS has consistently demonstrated very principled conduct and has earned its reputation for trust and integrity while building a highly successful global business. The Company’s core values are: Integrity, Responsibility, Excellence, Pioneering and Unity.\\nThe TCoC serves as a moral guide and a governing framework for responsible corporate \\ncitizenship. It sets out guidelines on various topics including respect for human rights, prohibition of bribery and corruption, recognition of employees’ freedom of association, and avoidance of conflicts of interest.\\nEvery employee of the Company is required to sign the TCoC at the time of joining. Web-based \\nannual refresher courses are mandated to ensure continued awareness of the Code. Further, frequent communications from the leadership, reiterate the importance of the Company values and the TCoC.\\nCustomers are made aware of the TCoC principles in contract discussions, and through \\ninclusion of specific clauses in proposals and contracts.\\nEmployees also undergo Web-based mandatory training every year on Anti-bribery and ethical \\nbehaviour. They can raise ethics concerns on Ultimatix – the intranet portal of the Company, which are investigated and tracked to closure by the HR department. Employees and other stakeholders can also report any non-compliance to the TCoC or to the laws of the land by senior executives directly to the Chairman of the Audit Committee under the Whistle blower Policy without fear of retaliation. Information about these channels is communicated to employees as part of the mandatory training modules.\\n3 GRI 2-15\\n4 GRI 2-11\\n5  https://www.tcs.com/tata-code-of-conduct\\n6 GRI 2-12 Integrated Annual Report 2023-2495 Corporate  Governanc e R eport  \\nMaterial Topic TCS’ Approach\\nCompliance to laws of the countries in which we operate, as well as global legislation such as \\nForeign Corrupt Practices Act, Bribery Act, 2010, etc. are monitored through formal compliance procedures led by the Corporate compliance office. Changes to legislation are closely monitored, risks are evaluated and effectively managed across the business operations.\\nGovernance, Risk and Compliance are overseen by the Compliance Officer, Chief Risk Officer \\nand the Chief Human Resources Officer who report to the Chief Operating Officer and Executive Director (“COO & ED”), and CEO & MD respectively. At the apex level, the Audit Committee headed by an Independent Director oversees compliance to the TCoC, Anti-Bribery and Anti-Corruption Policy, Gift and Hospitality Policy and also to the external regulations. \\nTax Strategy\\n7TCS is committed to comply with the applicable laws and regulations, and believes in reporting to the respective tax authorities, relevant information that is complete and accurate, in a timely manner.\\nTCS does not engage in aggressive and contrived tax planning or tax structuring for the purpose \\nof gaining tax advantages. TCS’s tax policy is to optimize the tax cost, avail tax incentives where available, while achieving 100 per cent compliance with the spirit as well as the letter of the tax laws and regulations in all countries in which it operates. Compliance is achieved through a robust compliance reporting and monitoring process, with a strong governance on minimizing the tax risk. TCS has zero tolerance towards tax evasion, or the facilitation of tax evasion, by\\n itself or b\\ny its employees or vendors.\\nTCS maintains open and collaborative relationships with governments and tax authorities worldwide. Where appropriate, TCS seeks advance clearance from tax authorities on the proposed tax treatment of transactions, helping pre-empt future disputes.\\nBoard Oversight of Sustainability Matters\\n8TCS’ approach to sustainable growth is built on the belief that it can expand its business by creating longer term value for all its stakeholders, including employees, customers, suppliers and local communities, while also valuing the environment. The various sustainability topics material to TCS are overseen by the relevant Board committees, as outlined below:\\nMaterial Sustainability Topics Board Committee\\nFinancial reporting, robustness of internal controls and risk management systems, auditor remuneration, compliance to policies around insider trading, whistle blower, ethics and TCoC.Audit Committee\\nRisk management policy and plan, management of foreign exchange risks, cyber security risks, data privacy risks and intellectual property infringement risks.Risk Management Committee\\nRecommend composition of Board and its committees, appointment/re-appointment of directors and Key Managerial Personnel (“KMP”), design executive directors’ remuneration, recommend remuneration policy for directors, executive team and KMP , evaluation of the performance of the Board, Committees and Directors.Nomination and Remuneration Committee\\nHealth and safety at the workplace, shareholder grievances and other sustainability initiatives.Stakeholders’ Relationship Committee\\nCommunity initiatives and Corporate Social Responsibility, including compliances.Corporate Social Responsibility Commttee\\nSuccession planning TCS’ philosophy of empowering employees, its industry-leading talent retention, and a decentralized organization structure that devolves executive decision-making across all business units have resulted in a large and deep bench of leadership talent that enables robust succession planning and continuity and consistency in strategy. Succession planning for the top two leadership positions in each business unit is reviewed by senior management. Additionally, heads of business units carry out succession planning for key functions within their units.\\nSuccession planning at senior management levels is reviewed by the Board. Business or unit \\nheads are invited to present on specific topics at Board meetings from time to time, offering an opportunity to the directors to assess their values, competencies, and capabilities.\\n7 GRI 207-1, GRI 207-2, GRI 207-3.

That includes principles on protecting and safeguarding human rights, treating all persons with respect and dignity while safeguarding their rights, the abolition of forced and compulsory labor, child labor in the supply chain and strong corporate governance practices including anti-corruption and bribery and promoting fair business practices across the supply chain. TCoC also requires its suppliers to protect the environment and make conscious use of scarce natural resources in their business processes and at the same time highlighting the importance of health and safety in its workplace and expects the supplier to comply with sustainable business practices in letter and spirit in turn for its employees.\\nThe Company supports the principles contained in the Universal Declaration of Human Rights, \\nthe ILO Declaration on Fundamental Principles and Rights at Work, and the United Nations Guiding Principles on Business and Human Rights. It works with its suppliers to ensure that they too are fully aligned with these principles.\\nII.\\n Board of Dir\\nectors\\n i.

TCS believes that everyone is born with equal potential, but not equal opportunity and it is the vision of TCS to empower people and communities to build self-reliance while promoting the core values of fairness, equity, and respect for human rights.We live in interesting times with technologies like Artiﬁcial Intelligence dominating the global conversation, the human impact of natural disasters calling attention to the need for climate adaptation, and a worldwide call to action for inclusive growth as economies transition post the pandemic.\\nOverview Inadequate adult literacy is a problem preventing India \\nfrom achieving its full economic potential. Majority of the non-literate population comprises women, and from marginalized communities. TCS’ Literacy as a Service (LaaS) program addresses non-literacy among adults and creates awareness of key citizen entitlements. It serves the dual purpose of improving the literacy rate in the country and promoting social inclusion and ﬁnancial stability for marginalized communities. LaaS’ innovative teaching method leverages technology, the theory of cognition, and the laws of perception. The program’s creative means of delivery uses animated graphic patterns for easy visual and auditory learning.\\nIntegr ated Annual Report 2023-24118 Corpor ate Social Responsibility\\nThis past year TCS has made signiﬁcant progress in its mission, empowering over 7 million people through its CSR programs including big bets aimed at people with highest need, in communities where resources are low, while using its core strengths to make a meaningful impact. This resulted in  upward socio-economic mobility for \\n797,749 people, building equitable and inclusive pathways for 405,775 women, 455,692 youth and 547,311 from marginalized groups.\\nThis was achieved by scaling TCS’ high impact programs \\nacross India and 43 countries around the world, against four strategic themes (and eight focus areas): provide a 21st century education for all (Education and Research, Literacy to Livelihood), help citizens equitably access good jobs of tomorrow (Employment through Skilling, Digital Entrepreneurship), enable delivery of world class front-line services in poorest districts (Healthcare, Digital Inclusion), and accelerate the just transition to a green economy (Water, Climate and Sustainability). No one organization can do this alone, and TCS through its purpose ecosystem engaged the key stakeholders to support the needs of the local communities.\\nTCS served 20,342 marginalized people through its \\nLiteracy as a Service program, empowering them through functional, ﬁnancial, and digital literacy.

To achieve these targets, the green-house gas management approach has four key levers – green infrastructure, green IT, IT-enabled operational efficiencies, and renewable energy.\\n Commitment t\\no Science Based Targets initiative (SBTi)\\n In June 2022, TCS has r\\nesponded to SBTi’s urgent call for corporate climate action by committing to align with 1.5°C and net-zero \\nthrough the Business Ambition for 1.5°C campaign. This is published on SBTi website and can be viewed at Companies taking action - https://sciencebasedtargets.org/companies-taking-action. TCS is working on the next steps to developing company targets for validation by SBTi.\\n Green In\\nfrastructure and IT enabled operational efficiency:\\n All new c\\nampuses owned by TCS are designed according to green building standards for energy and resource efficiency. They have \\nroof-top solar photovoltaic installations to reduce the carbon footprint. The total Built Up Area occupied by TCS has increased YoY from 36.6 Mn to 38.23 million sq.ft. in FY 2023-24. With the increasing footprint, TCS is committed to expand consciously its green footprint, to align with its sustainability goals. In FY 2023-24, TCS got Platinum IGBC certification for 2 additional existing buildings namely Sholinganallur, Chennai and Deccan Park, Hyderabad. The % green certified area over built up area was 64.6% in  \\nFY\\n 2022-23 and has incr\\neased to 67.3% this year. This accounts for 39 TCS offices and campuses with over 25.74 million sq.ft of \\narea under certified green building by Indian Green Building Council.\\n75  GRI 305-1; GRI 305-2, GRI 305-4. Scope 1 emissions have been calculated using the emissions factors published by the DEFRA conversion factors 2023. For Scope 2 emissions – for India, the source is the emission factor is the CO2 Baseline Database for the Indian Power Sector, User Guide, Version 19.0, December 2023, published by the Central Electricity Authority of India. This emission factor [(0.716 tCO2/ MWh) by CEA includes the captive power injection into the grid and is adjusted for RE transactions through open access (in power exchanges)]. As TCS, India procures electricity from the India grid, which is a mix of conventional and renewable energy, the emission factor of 0.716 tCO2/ MWh is considered more appropriate. For Australia, Canada, North America, and UK emission factors specific to the region published by local authorities are used. For other countries IEA v6 emission factors (01/2024) and GHG protocol v19 (04/2023) – eGRID 2021 have been used as appropriate to the source of electricity procured.\\n76 GRI 305-5 Integrated Annual Report 2023-24153 Business Responsibility & Sustainability Report\\n During the year , several initiatives were aligned to achieve the carbon targets which included those in building and IT \\ninfrastructure.

The areas covered under green IT initiatives include IT energy optimization in data centers and equipment rooms. TCS’ data centers at Yantra Park (Thane) and Siruseri (Chennai) have a weighted average PUE of 1.7. Apart from the two main data centers, TCS also has 54 equipment rooms for business as usual (BAU) activities, wherein the weighted average PUE has reduced from 1.88 in FY 2022-23 to 1.76 in FY 2023-24.\\n The dat\\na centre at Yantra Park uses 100% Renewable Energy (RE) while the one at Siruseri uses 73% RE. The power consumed by \\nthe data centers at Yantra Park and Siruseri were 5.52 MWh and 1.65 MWh respectively during the reporting year FY 2023-24. In addition to the above, green attributes are considered in every IT asset procurement.\\n TCS\\n’ IoT-based Real-time Energy Management System (TCS Clever Energy™) initiative involves real time monitoring to optimize \\nthe operational energy efficiency across all offices. The smart, scalable, analytics driven IoT solution uses TCS Connected Universe Platform (TCUP) IoT platform, which forms the backbone, enabling visualization of data acquired from various locations and facilities’ energy meters and sensors. Other energy optimization initiatives include:\\n • IT Equipmen\\nt optimization (rack consolidation, server consolidation and procurement of energy efficient devices)\\n • UPS optimiz\\nation (right sizing of UPS, replacement of old technology UPS with modular UPS)\\n • Cooling optimiz\\nation (switching off excess capacity cooling units, maintaining return set temperature at 24 +/- 1 deg C, \\nreplacing old with new technology cooling units) \\n • Leakag\\ne reduction (proper alignment of racks and perforated tiles, partitioning to reduce cooling area, cold aisle \\ncontainment, blanking panel, active tiles and soft partitioning\\n Rene\\nwable Energy:\\n The roof t\\nop solar photo voltaic installations this year remained at 10.2 MWp contributing to 3 percent of total electricity use in \\nFY 2023-24. A rooftop solar PV of 260 KWp has been planned for implementation in early FY 2024-25. The Company increased its renewable energy procurement through a) switch over to green tariffs for its operations in Ahmedabad, Kolkata, Chennai, Kochi and Trivandrum branches, b) Green energy units procurement through Power Purchase Agreements (PPA) at two locations in Chennai viz. Ambattur and Chennai One, Magnum, which cumulatively added about 6.5 million green units to the renewable energy portfolio). The renewable energy procurement has resulted in an increase in renewable energy use to 74 percent of total energy use.

Pro\\nvide details related to waste management by the entity, in the following format77:\\n TCS being an IT ser\\nvices and consulting organization, TCS does not manufacture physical products and therefore do not use any \\nhazardous or toxic chemicals in core processes. The Company have office or facility operations, and the waste is generated from \\nthe auxiliary processes used to run these facilities. Based on the nature of its services, TCS’ facilities mostly generate electronic, electrical, and municipal solid waste. Potentially hazardous and regulated wastes such as lead-acid batteries and waste lube oil are generated in relatively smaller proportions which are disposed through government-approved recyclers as per regulations. E-waste is disposed to government approved e-waste recyclers.\\n TCS is c\\nommitted to sustain the best practices that have already been institutionalized like segregation of all recyclable wastes, \\n100% compliance to management practices for regulated wastes like hazardous and e-waste and 100% recycling of office and packaging paper and plastic. All TCS campuses, owned offices and leased offices that have available space are provided with on-site food waste management facilities such as biodigesters and organic waste converters (OWCs) and garden waste is treated by vermicomposting at TCS campuses where feasible. The company targets to maximize the recycling and reuse of all waste categories to divert waste from landfill.\\n In FY 2023-24, TCS has ob\\ntained zero waste to landfill (ZWL) certification was obtained for TCS Deccan Park facility at Hyderabad \\nafter having achieved a diversion rate of over 99% waste from landfill. This was done as a pilot project for feasibility. \\n TCS has oper\\national control procedures (OCPs) for waste management and handling of different categories of wastes which is \\navailable on the TCS intranet that has set procedures for waste segregation, handling, storage, and disposal of different waste categories.\\nParameter FY 2023-24 FY 2022-23#\\nTotal Waste generated [in metric tonnes (MT)]\\nPlastic waste (A) 137.3 46.7\\nE-waste (B) 297.5 415.0\\nBio-medical waste (C) 0.8 0.8\\nConstruction and demolition waste (D) 1,070.8 618.0\\nBattery waste (E) 261.0 387.0\\nRadioactive waste (F) NA NA\\nOther Hazardous waste.

Scope 3 emissions:  \\nCategory 1 & 2: Emission factors (spend based) for purchased and capital goods are taken from the latest available US EPA (Supply Chain GHG \\nEmission Factors for US Commodities and Industries v1.1.1) information for computer equipment, electrical equipment, office equipment, vehicles, and furniture items. The US EPA emission factors for categories 1 & 2 were adopted in FY23 and used in FY24 as well. There is a significant increase in Category 1 due to a new contract. Increase in category 2 is due to Return to Office (RTO)  Category 3: The well to tank (WTT) emissions from the fuel used in stationary and mobile combustion such as diesel in DG sets and owned vehicles, LPG or PNG in cafeteria, natural gas for space heating/ cooling, fuel used in hired vehicles (cabs/ buses) are included in this category since  FY 2023 and the same has been continued in FY2024 as well. There is an increase in emissions due to use of IEA emission factors for WTT and T&D in FY24. In FY23 the Company had used the DEFRA emission factors.  Category 4: Until FY 2022, TCS had included only emissions from transportation of IT assets considering its relative significance compared to other supplies. While the Company continues to capture emissions from transportation of IT assets based on spend based emission factors, emissions related to transportation of non -IT supplies were included. The non – IT supplies covered to estimate category 4 emissions include cafeteria/ canteen supplies, water supplies through tankers, housekeeping material, and other stationary supplies. Emission factors are taken from DEFRA 2023 for the transport emissions based on vehicle type and weight. There is a significant decrease in this category as the actual data were taken from the locations in FY24 compared to FY23 which was based on pilot study at few locations. The Company has also moved the waste disposal related transport emissions from Category 4 to 5 in FY24. .  \\nCategory 5: No change in approach in FY 2024. The emissions are based on disposal mechanisms (e.g., recycling, reuse, landfill) for different categories of waste (plastic, metal, e-waste, batteries, food waste, garden waste etc.,) and have been computed based on emission factors from DEFRA 2023. Slight increase in emission due to increased RTO and also due to inclusion of waste disposal related transportation under this category.  \\nCategory 6: In FY 2022, business travel included emissions from air and rail. In FY 2023 and FY 2024, business travel emissions also include hotel stays at various geographies during business travel. Relevant emission factors are taken from DEFRA 2023.  There is an increase in emissions due to increase in business travel and accommodation due to resumption and RTO. Category 7: In FY 2024, the employee commute related carbon emission includes those from TCS hired vehicles for transport of employees, personal employee commute, public employee commute & work from home (WFH) emissions. There is an increase in employee commute due to RTO in FY 2023-24 compared to previous year. Integrated Annual Report 2023-24159 Business Responsibility & Sustainability Report\\n3.

The respective Management and \\nBoard of Directors of the companies included in the Group are \\nresponsible for maintenance of adequate accounting records \\nin accordance with the provisions of the Act for safeguarding \\nthe assets of each company and for preventing and detecting \\nfrauds and other irregularities; the selection and application \\nof appropriate accounting policies; making judgments and \\nestimates that are reasonable and prudent; and the design, \\nimplementation and maintenance of adequate internal financial \\ncontrols, that were operating effectively for ensuring the \\naccuracy and completeness of the accounting records, relevant \\nto the preparation and presentation of the  consolidated \\nfinancial statements that give a true and fair view and are free \\nfrom material misstatement, whether due to fraud or error, \\nwhich have been used for the purpose of preparation of the \\nconsolidated financial statements by the Management and \\nBoard of Directors of the Holding Company, as aforesaid. Integrated Annual Report 2023-24175 Consolidated Financial Statements\\nIn preparing the consolidated financial statements, the \\nrespective Management and Board of Directors of the \\ncompanies included in the Group are responsible for assessing \\nthe ability of each company to continue as a going concern, \\ndisclosing, as applicable, matters related to going concern \\nand using the going concern basis of accounting unless the \\nrespective Board of Directors either intends to liquidate the \\nCompany or to cease operations, or has no realistic alternative \\nbut to do so.\\nThe respective Board of Directors of the companies included in \\nthe Group are responsible for overseeing the financial reporting \\nprocess of each company.\\nAuditor’s Responsibilities for the Audit of the Consolidated \\nFinancial Statements\\nOur objectives are to obtain reasonable assurance about \\nwhether the consolidated financial statements as a whole \\nare free from material misstatement, whether due to fraud \\nor error, and to issue an auditor’s report that includes our \\nopinion. Reasonable assurance is a high level of assurance, but \\nis not a guarantee that an audit conducted in accordance with \\nSAs will always detect a material misstatement when it exists. \\nMisstatements can arise from fraud or error and are considered \\nmaterial if, individually or in the aggregate, they could reasonably be expected to influence the economic decisions \\nof users taken on the basis of these consolidated financial \\nstatements.\\nAs part of an audit in accordance with SAs, we exercise \\nprofessional judgment and maintain professional skepticism \\nthroughout the audit. We also:\\n•\\n Identif\\ny and assess the risks of material misstatement \\nof the consolidated financial statements, whether due \\nto fraud or error, design and perform audit procedures \\nresponsive to those risks, and obtain audit evidence that is \\nsufficient and appropriate to provide a basis for our opinion. \\nThe risk of not detecting a material misstatement resulting \\nfrom fraud is higher than for one resulting from error, as fraud may involve collusion, forgery, intentional omissions, \\nmisrepresentations, or the override of internal control.\\n•\\n Obt\\nain an understanding of internal control relevant to \\nthe audit in order to design audit procedures that are \\nappropriate in the circumstances. Under Section 143(3)\\n(i) of the Act, we are also responsible for expressing our \\nopinion on whether the company has adequate internal \\nfinancial controls with reference to financial statements in \\nplace and the operating effectiveness of such controls.\\n• Ev\\naluate the appropriateness of accounting policies used \\nand the reasonableness of accounting estimates and \\nrelated disclosures made by the Management and Board of \\nDirectors.\\n• Conclude on the appr\\nopriateness of the Management \\nand Board of Directors use of the going concern basis \\nof accounting in preparation of consolidated financial \\nstatements and, based on the audit evidence obtained, \\nwhether a material uncertainty exists related to events \\nor conditions that may cast significant doubt on the appropriateness of this assumption. If we conclude that a material uncertainty exists, we are required to draw attention in our auditor’s report to the related disclosures \\nin the consolidated financial statements or, if such \\ndisclosures are inadequate, to modify our opinion. Our \\nconclusions are based on the audit evidence obtained up to \\nthe date of our auditor’s report. However, future events or \\nconditions may cause the Group to cease to continue as a \\ngoing concern.\\n•\\n Ev\\naluate the overall presentation, structure and content \\nof the consolidated financial statements, including the \\ndisclosures, and whether the consolidated financial \\nstatements represent the underlying transactions and \\nevents in a manner that achieves fair presentation.\\nWe communicate with those charged with governance of \\nthe Holding Company and such other companies included in the consolidated financial statements of which we are the \\nindependent auditors regarding, among other matters, the \\nplanned scope and timing of the audit and significant audit \\nfindings, including any significant deficiencies in internal control \\nthat we identify during our audit.\\nWe also provide those charged with governance with a \\nstatement that we have complied with relevant ethical \\nrequirements regarding independence, and to communicate \\nwith them all relationships and other matters that may \\nreasonably be thought to bear on our independence, and where \\napplicable, related safeguards.\\nFrom the matters communicated with those charged with \\ngovernance, we determine those matters that were of most \\nsignificance in the audit of the consolidated financial statements \\nof the current period and are therefore the key audit matters. \\nWe describe these matters in our auditor’s report unless law or \\nregulation precludes public disclosure about the matter or when, \\nin extremely rare circumstances, we determine that a matter \\nshould not be communicated in our report because the adverse \\nconsequences of doing so would reasonably be expected to outweigh the public interest benefits of such communication.\\nReport on Other Legal and Regulatory Requirements\\n1.\\n As requir\\ned by the Companies (Auditor’s Report) Order, \\n2020 (“the Order”) issued by the Central Government of \\nIndia in terms of Section 143(11) of the Act, we give in \\nthe “Annexure A” a statement on the matters specified in \\nparagraphs 3 and 4 of the Order, to the extent applicable.\\n2.

These responsibilities include the design, implementation and maintenance of adequate internal financial controls that were operating effectively for ensuring the orderly and efficient conduct of its business, including adherence to the respective company’s policies, the safeguarding of its assets, the prevention and detection of frauds and errors, the accuracy and completeness of the accounting records, and the timely preparation of reliable financial information, as required under the Act.\\nAuditor’s Responsibility\\nOur responsibility is to express an opinion on the internal financial controls with reference to financial statements based on our audit. We conducted our audit in accordance with the Guidance Note and the Standards on Auditing, prescribed under Section 143(10) of the Act, to the extent applicable to an audit of internal financial controls with reference to financial statements. Those Standards and the Guidance Note require that we comply with ethical requirements and plan and perform the audit to obtain reasonable assurance about whether adequate internal financial controls with reference to financial statements were established and maintained and if such controls operated effectively in all material respects.Annexure B to the Independent Auditor’s Report on the Consolidated Financial \\nStatements of Tata Consultancy Services Limited for the year ended 31 March 2024\\nOur audit involves performing procedures to obtain audit \\nevidence about the adequacy of the internal financial controls with reference to financial statements and their operating effectiveness. Our audit of internal financial controls with reference to financial statements included obtaining an understanding of internal financial controls with reference to financial statements, assessing the risk that a material weakness exists, and testing and evaluating the design and operating effectiveness of internal control based on the assessed risk. The procedures selected depend on the auditor’s judgement, including the assessment of the risks of material misstatement of the consolidated financial statements, whether due to fraud or error.\\nWe believe that the audit evidence we have obtained is \\nsufficient and appropriate to provide a basis for our audit opinion on the internal financial controls with reference to financial statements.\\nMeaning of Internal Financial Controls with Reference to \\nFinancial StatementsA company’s internal financial controls with reference to financial statements is a process designed to provide reasonable assurance regarding the reliability of financial reporting and the preparation of financial statements for external purposes in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles. A company’s internal financial controls with reference to financial statements include those policies and procedures that (1) pertain to the maintenance of records that, in reasonable detail, accurately and fairly reflect the transactions and dispositions of the assets of the company; (2) provide reasonable assurance that transactions are recorded as necessary to permit preparation of financial statements in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles, and that receipts and expenditures of the company are being made only in accordance with authorisations of management and directors of the company; and (3) provide reasonable assurance regarding prevention or timely detection of unauthorised acquisition, use, or disposition of the company’s assets that could have a material effect on the financial statements.\\nInherent Limitations of Internal Financial Controls with \\nReference to Financial StatementsBecause of the inherent limitations of internal financial controls with reference to financial statements, including the possibility of collusion or improper management override of controls, material misstatements due to error or fraud may occur and not be detected. Also, projections of any evaluation of the internal financial controls with reference to financial statements to future periods are subject to the risk that the internal financial controls with reference to financial statements may become inadequate because of changes in conditions, or that the degree of compliance with the policies or procedures may deteriorate.\\nFor B S R & Co.

The Group offers a \\nconsulting-led, cognitive powered, integrated portfolio of \\nIT, business and engineering services and solutions. This is \\ndelivered through its unique Location-Independent Agile \\ndelivery model recognised as a benchmark of excellence in \\nsoftware development.\\n The Company is a public limit\\ned company incorporated and \\ndomiciled in India. The address of its corporate office is TCS \\nHouse, Raveline Street, Fort, Mumbai - 400001. As at March \\n31, 2024, Tata Sons Private Limited, the holding company \\nowned 71.74% of the Company’s equity share capital. \\n The Board of Dir\\nectors approved the consolidated financial \\nstatements for the year ended March 31, 2024 and \\nauthorised for issue on April 12, 2024.\\n2) Sta\\ntement of compliance\\n These consolida\\nted financial statements have been \\nprepared in accordance with the Indian Accounting \\nStandards (referred to as “Ind AS”) prescribed under \\nsection 133 of the Companies Act, 2013 read with the \\nCompanies (Indian Accounting Standards) Rules as \\namended from time to time.\\n3) Basis of prepar\\nation\\n These consolida\\nted financial statements have been \\nprepared on historical cost basis except for certain financial \\ninstruments and defined benefit plans which are measured \\nat fair value or amortised cost at the end of each reporting \\nperiod. Historical cost is generally based on the fair value of \\nthe consideration given in exchange for goods and services. \\nFair value is the price that would be received to sell an \\nasset or paid to transfer a liability in an orderly transaction \\nbetween market participants at the measurement date. All \\nassets and liabilities have been classified as current and \\nnon-current as per the Group’s normal operating cycle. \\nBased on the nature of services rendered to customers \\nand time elapsed between deployment of resources and the realisation in cash and cash equivalents of the \\nconsideration for such services rendered, the Group has considered an operating cycle of 12 months.   \\n The st\\natement of cash flows has been prepared under \\nindirect method, whereby profit or loss is adjusted for the \\neffects of transactions of a non-cash nature, any deferrals \\nor accruals of past or future operating cash receipts or \\npayments and items of income or expense associated \\nwith investing or financing cash flows. The cash flows \\nfrom operating, investing and financing activities of the \\nGroup are segregated. The Group considers all highly liquid \\ninvestments that are readily convertible to known amounts \\nof cash and are subject to an insignificant risk of changes in \\nvalue to be cash equivalents. The functional currency of the Compan y and its Indian \\nsubsidiaries is the Indian Rupee ( `). The functional currency \\nof foreign subsidiaries is the currency of the primary \\neconomic environment in which the entity operates. \\nForeign currency transactions are recorded at exchange \\nrates prevailing on the date of the transaction. Foreign \\ncurrency denominated monetary assets and liabilities \\nare retranslated at the exchange rate prevailing on the \\nbalance sheet dates and exchange gains and losses arising \\non settlement and restatement are recognised in the \\nstatement of profit and loss. Non-monetary assets and \\nliabilities that are measured in terms of historical cost in \\nforeign currencies are not retranslated.\\n The mat\\nerial accounting policy information related to \\npreparation of the consolidated financial statements have \\nbeen discussed in the respective notes.\\n4) Basis of cons\\nolidation\\n The Company c\\nonsolidates all entities which are controlled \\nby it.\\n The Company es\\ntablishes control when; it has power over \\nthe entity, is exposed, or has rights, to variable returns \\nfrom its involvement with the entity and has the ability to \\naffect the entity’s returns by using its power over relevant activities of the entity.\\n Entities c\\nontrolled by the Company are consolidated from \\nthe date control commences until the date control ceases.\\n The results of sub\\nsidiaries acquired, or sold, during the year \\nare consolidated from the effective date of acquisition and \\nup to the effective date of disposal, as appropriate.\\n The financial st\\natements of the Group companies are \\nconsolidated on a line-by-line basis and all inter-company \\ntransactions, balances, income and expenses are \\neliminated in full on consolidation.\\n Changes in the Compan\\ny’s interests in subsidiaries that do \\nnot result in a loss of control are accounted for as equity \\ntransactions. The carrying amount of the Company’s \\ninterests and the non-controlling interests are adjusted \\nto reflect the changes in their relative interests in the \\nsubsidiaries.

Revisions to accounting estimates are \\nrecognised in the period in which the estimates are revised \\nand future periods are affected.\\n The Group uses the f\\nollowing critical accounting \\njudgements, estimates and assumptions in preparation of \\nits consolidated financial statements:\\n (a) Re\\nvenue recognition\\n  Re\\nvenue for fixed-price contracts is recognised \\nusing percentage-of-completion method. The \\nGroup estimates the future cost-to-completion of \\nthe contracts which is used to determine degree of \\ncompletion of the performance obligation.\\n  The Group e\\nxercises judgement for identification of \\nperformance obligations, determination of transaction price, ascribing the transaction price to each distinct performance obligation and in determining whether \\nthe performance obligation is satisfied at a point \\nin time or over a period of time. These judgements \\nhave been explained in detail under the revenue \\nrecognition note (Refer note 12).\\n (b) Useful liv\\nes of property, plant and equipment\\n  The Group r\\neviews the useful life of property, \\nplant and equipment at the end of each reporting period. This reassessment may result in change in \\ndepreciation expense in future periods (Refer note \\n10(a)).\\n (c) Impairment of g\\noodwill\\n  The Group es\\ntimates the value-in-use of the cash \\ngenerating units (CGUs) based on the future cash \\nflows after considering current economic conditions \\nand trends, estimated future operating results and \\ngrowth rate and anticipated future economic and \\nregulatory conditions. The estimated cash flows are \\ndeveloped using internal forecasts. The discount rates \\nused for the CGUs represent the weighted average \\ncost of capital based on the historical market returns of comparable companies (Refer note 10(b)).\\n (d) Fair v\\nalue measurement of financial instruments\\n  When the fair v\\nalue of financial assets and financial \\nliabilities recorded in the balance sheet cannot be \\nmeasured based on quoted prices in active markets, their fair value is measured using valuation techniques \\nincluding the Discounted Cash Flow model. The inputs \\nto these models are taken from observable markets \\nwhere possible, but where this is not feasible, a \\ndegree of judgement is required in establishing fair \\nvalues. Judgements include considerations of inputs \\nsuch as liquidity risk, credit risk and volatility. Changes \\nin assumptions about these factors could affect the \\nreported fair value of financial instruments.\\n (e) Impairment of financial asse\\nts (other than at fair \\nvalue)\\n  Measuremen\\nt of impairment of financial assets \\nrequire use of estimates, which have been explained \\nin the note on financial assets, financial liabilities and \\nequity instruments, under impairment of financial \\nassets (other than at fair value) (Refer note 8)).\\n (f) Pro\\nvision for income tax and deferred tax assets\\n  The Group uses judg\\nements based on the relevant \\nrulings in the areas of allocation of revenue, costs, \\nallowances and disallowances which is exercised while \\ndetermining the provision for income tax. A deferred \\ntax asset is recognised to the extent that it is probable that future taxable profit will be available against \\nwhich the deductible temporary differences and tax \\nlosses can be utilised. Accordingly, the Group exercises \\nits judgement to reassess the carrying amount of \\ndeferred tax assets at the end of each reporting \\nperiod.\\n (g) Pro\\nvisions and contingent liabilities\\n  The Group es\\ntimates the provisions that have present \\nobligations as a result of past events and it is probable \\nthat outflow of resources will be required to settle the \\nobligations. These provisions are reviewed at the end of each reporting period and are adjusted to reflect \\nthe current best estimates. \\n  The Group uses signific\\nant judgements to assess \\ncontingent liabilities. Contingent liabilities are \\ndisclosed when there is a possible obligation arising \\nfrom past events, the existence of which will be \\nconfirmed only by the occurrence or non-occurrence of one or more uncertain future events not wholly \\nwithin the control of the Group or a present obligation \\nthat arises from past events where it is either not \\nprobable that an outflow of resources will be required \\nto settle the obligation or a reliable estimate of the \\namount cannot be made. Contingent assets are \\nneither recognised nor disclosed in the consolidated \\nfinancial statements.\\n (h) Employ\\nee benefits \\n  The accoun\\nting of employee benefit plans in the \\nnature of defined benefit requires the Group to use \\nassumptions. These assumptions have been explained \\nunder employee benefits note (Refer note 14). Notes forming part of Consolidated Financial Statements\\nIntegrated Annual Report 2023-24188 Consolidated Financial Statements 2023-24\\n (i) Leases\\n  The Group e\\nvaluates if an arrangement qualifies to \\nbe a lease as per the requirements of Ind AS 116. \\nIdentification of a lease requires significant judgement. \\nThe Group uses significant judgement in assessing the \\nlease term (including anticipated renewals) and the \\napplicable discount rate. \\n  The Group de\\ntermines the lease term as the \\nnoncancellable period of a lease, together with both \\nperiods covered by an option to extend the lease \\nif the Group is reasonably certain to exercise that \\noption; and periods covered by an option to terminate \\nthe lease if the Group is reasonably certain not to \\nexercise that option. In assessing whether the Group \\nis reasonably certain to exercise an option to extend a \\nlease, or not to exercise an option to terminate a lease, \\nit considers all relevant facts and circumstances that \\ncreate an economic incentive for the Group to exercise \\nthe option to extend the lease, or not to exercise the \\noption to terminate the lease. The Group revises the \\nlease term if there is a change in the noncancellable \\nperiod of a lease. \\n  The discoun\\nt rate is generally based on the \\nincremental borrowing rate specific to the lease being \\nevaluated or for a portfolio of leases with similar \\ncharacteristics.\\n6) Recen\\nt pronouncements\\n Ministr\\ny of Corporate Affairs (“MCA”) notifies new \\nstandards or amendments to the existing standards under \\nCompanies (Indian Accounting Standards) Rules as issued \\nfrom time to time. For the year ended March 31, 2024, \\nMCA has not notified any new standards or amendments to \\nthe existing standards applicable to the Group. \\n7) Business c\\nombinations\\n The Group acc\\nounts for its business combinations under \\nacquisition method of accounting. Acquisition related costs are recognised in the consolidated statement of profit and loss as incurred. The acquiree’s identifiable assets, \\nliabilities and contingent liabilities that meet the condition for recognition are recognised at their fair values at the \\nacquisition date.\\n Pur\\nchase consideration paid in excess of the fair value \\nof net assets acquired is recognised as goodwill. Where \\nthe fair value of identifiable assets and liabilities exceed the cost of acquisition, after reassessing the fair values \\nof the net assets and contingent liabilities, the excess is \\nrecognised as capital reserve.\\n The int\\nerest of non-controlling shareholders is initially \\nmeasured either at fair value or at the non-controlling \\ninterests’ proportionate share of the acquiree’s identifiable \\nnet assets. The choice of measurement basis is made on an \\nacquisition-by-acquisition basis. Subsequent to acquisition, \\nthe carrying amount of non-controlling interests is the amount of those interests at initial recognition plus the \\nnon-controlling interests’ share of subsequent changes in \\nequity of subsidiaries.\\n Business combina\\ntions arising from transfers of interests in \\nentities that are under common control are accounted at \\nhistorical cost. The difference between any consideration \\ngiven and the aggregate historical carrying amounts of \\nassets and liabilities of the acquired entity is recorded in \\nshareholders’ equity.\\n8) \\n Financial asse\\nts, financial liabilities and equity \\ninstruments\\n Financial assets and liabilities ar\\ne recognised when the \\nGroup becomes a party to the contractual provisions of \\nthe instrument. Financial assets and liabilities are initially \\nmeasured at fair value, except for trade receivables which \\nare initially measured at transaction price. Transaction \\ncosts that are directly attributable to the acquisition or \\nissue of financial assets and financial liabilities (other than \\nfinancial assets and financial liabilities at fair value through \\nprofit or loss) are added to or deducted from the fair \\nvalue measured on initial recognition of financial asset or \\nfinancial liability. \\n The Group der\\necognises a financial asset only when the \\ncontractual rights to the cash flows from the asset expire, \\nor when it transfers the financial asset and substantially all \\nthe risks and rewards of ownership of the asset to another \\nentity. The Group derecognises financial liabilities when, and only when, the Group’s obligations are discharged, \\ncancelled or have expired.\\n Cash and cash equiv\\nalents\\n The Group c\\nonsiders all highly liquid investments, which \\nare readily convertible into known amounts of cash that are \\nsubject to an insignificant risk of change in value to be cash \\nequivalents. Cash and cash equivalents consist of balances \\nwith banks which are unrestricted for withdrawal and \\nusage.\\n Financial assets a\\nt amortised cost\\n Financial assets ar\\ne subsequently measured at amortised \\ncost if these financial assets are held within a business \\nwhose objective is to hold these assets in order to collect \\ncontractual cash flows and the contractual terms of the \\nfinancial assets give rise on specified dates to cash flows \\nthat are solely payments of principal and interest on the \\nprincipal amount outstanding.\\n Financial assets a\\nt fair value through other \\ncomprehensive income\\n Financial assets ar\\ne measured at fair value through other \\ncomprehensive income if these financial assets are held \\nwithin a business whose objective is achieved by both \\ncollecting contractual cash flows on specified dates that are \\nsolely payments of principal and interest on the principal \\namount outstanding and selling financial assets. Notes forming part of Consolidated Financial Statements\\nIntegrated Annual Report 2023-24189 Consolidated Financial Statements 2023-24\\n The Group has made an irrevocable election to present \\nsub\\nsequent changes in the fair value of equity investments \\nnot held for trading in other comprehensive income.\\n Financial assets a\\nt fair value through profit or loss\\n Financial assets ar\\ne measured at fair value through profit \\nor loss unless they are measured at amortised cost or at \\nfair value through other comprehensive income on initial \\nrecognition. The transaction costs directly attributable \\nto the acquisition of financial assets and liabilities at fair \\nvalue through profit or loss are immediately recognised in \\nstatement of profit and loss. \\n Financial liabilities\\n Financial liabilities are measur\\ned at amortised cost using \\nthe effective interest method.\\n Equity ins\\ntruments\\n An equity instrumen\\nt is a contract that evidences residual \\ninterest in the assets of the company after deducting all of \\nits liabilities. Equity instruments issued by the Group are \\nrecognised at the proceeds received net of direct issue cost.\\n Deriva\\ntive accounting\\n • Instrumen\\nts in hedging relationship\\n  The Group designa\\ntes certain foreign exchange \\nforward, currency options and futures contracts as hedge instruments in respect of foreign exchange risks. \\nThese hedges are accounted for as cash flow hedges.\\n  The Group uses hedging ins\\ntruments that are \\ngoverned by the financial risk management policy as \\napproved by the Risk Management Committee. The \\npolicy provides principles on the use of such financial \\nderivatives consistent with the risk management \\nstrategy of the company and its subsidiaries. While \\ndetermining the appropriate hedge ratio, the Group \\ntakes into consideration the prevailing macro-\\neconomic conditions, the availability and liquidity of \\nthe hedging instruments, tolerance levels for hedge \\nineffectiveness and the costs of hedging. The hedging \\nactivities are reviewed by the Risk Management \\nCommittee every quarter and future course of action \\nis determined.\\n  The hedge ins\\ntruments are designated and \\ndocumented as hedges at the inception of the \\ncontract. The Group determines the existence of \\nan economic relationship between the hedging \\ninstrument and hedged item based on the currency, \\namount and timing of their respective cash flows. \\nThe effectiveness of hedge instruments to reduce \\nthe risk associated with the exposure being hedged \\nis assessed and measured at inception and on an \\nongoing basis. If the hedged future cash flows are no \\nlonger expected to occur, then the amounts that have been accumulated in other equity are immediately reclassified in net foreign exchange gains in the \\nstatement of profit and loss.\\n  The eff\\nective portion of change in the fair value of the \\ndesignated hedging instrument is recognised in the \\nother comprehensive income and accumulated under \\nthe heading cash flow hedging reserve.\\n  The Group separ\\nates the intrinsic value and time value \\nof an option and designates as hedging instruments \\nonly the change in intrinsic value of the option. \\nThe change in fair value of the intrinsic value and \\ntime value of an option is recognised in the other \\ncomprehensive income and accounted as a separate component of equity. Such amounts are reclassified \\ninto the statement of profit and loss when the related \\nhedged items affect profit and loss.\\n  Hedge acc\\nounting is discontinued when the hedging \\ninstrument expires or is sold, terminated or no \\nlonger qualifies for hedge accounting. Any gain or loss recognised in other comprehensive income and \\naccumulated in equity till that time remains and is \\nrecognised in statement of profit and loss when the \\nforecasted transaction ultimately affects profit and loss. Any gain or loss is recognised immediately in the \\nstatement of profit and loss when the hedge becomes \\nineffective.\\n • Instrumen\\nts not in hedging relationship\\n  The Group en\\nters into contracts that are effective \\nas hedges from an economic perspective, but they \\ndo not qualify for hedge accounting. The change in \\nthe fair value of such instrument is recognised in the \\nstatement of profit and loss.\\n Impairment of financial asse\\nts (other than at fair value)\\n The Group assesses a\\nt each date of balance sheet whether \\na financial asset or a group of financial assets is impaired. \\nInd AS 109 requires expected credit losses to be measured \\nthrough a loss allowance. The Group recognises lifetime \\nexpected losses for all contract assets and / or all trade \\nreceivables that do not constitute a financing transaction. \\nIn determining the allowance for expected credit losses, \\nthe Group has used a practical expedient by computing the expected credit loss allowance for trade receivables \\nbased on a provision matrix. The provision matrix takes into \\naccount historical credit loss experience and is adjusted \\nfor forward looking information. The expected credit loss \\nallowance is based on the ageing of the receivables that are due and allowance rates used in the provision matrix. \\nFor all other financial assets, expected credit losses are \\nmeasured at an amount equal to the 12-months expected \\ncredit losses or at an amount equal to the life time \\nexpected credit losses if the credit risk on the financial asset has increased significantly since initial recognition.

Fair values are determined in whole or in \\npart using a valuation model based on assumptions that are neither supported by prices from observable current market \\ntransactions in the same instrument nor are they based on available market data.\\n The cos\\nt of unquoted investments included in Level 3 of fair value hierarchy approximate their fair value because there is a wide \\nrange of possible fair value measurements and the cost represents estimate of fair value within that range.

Notes forming part of Consolidated Financial Statements\\nIntegrated Annual Report 2023-24200 Consolidated Financial Statements 2023-24\\n Market risk\\n Marke\\nt risk is the risk that the fair value or future cash flows of a financial instrument will fluctuate because of changes in market \\nprices. Such changes in the values of financial instruments may result from changes in the foreign currency exchange rates, \\ninterest rates, credit, liquidity and other market changes. The Group’s exposure to market risk is primarily on account of foreign \\ncurrency exchange rate risk.\\n • For\\neign currency exchange rate risk\\n  The fluctuation in f\\noreign currency exchange rates may have potential impact on the consolidated statement of profit and \\nloss and other comprehensive income and equity, where any transaction references more than one currency or where \\nassets / liabilities are denominated in a currency other than the functional currency of the respective entities. Considering \\nthe countries and economic environment in which the Group operates, its operations are subject to risks arising from \\nfluctuations in exchange rates in those countries. \\n  The Group, as per its risk manag\\nement policy, uses derivative instruments primarily to hedge foreign exchange. Further, any \\nmovement in the functional currencies of the various operations of the Group against major foreign currencies may impact \\nthe Group’s revenue in international business.\\n  The Group e\\nvaluates the impact of foreign exchange rate fluctuations by assessing its exposure to exchange rate risks. It \\nhedges a part of these risks by using derivative financial instruments in line with its risk management policies.\\n  The for\\neign exchange rate sensitivity is calculated by aggregation of the net foreign exchange rate exposure and a \\nsimultaneous parallel foreign exchange rates shift of all the currencies by 10% against the respective functional currencies of \\nTata Consultancy Services Limited and its subsidiaries.\\n  The follo\\nwing analysis has been worked out based on the net exposures for each of the subsidiaries and \\n  Ta\\nta Consultancy Services Limited as of the date of balance sheet which could affect the statement of profit and loss and \\nother comprehensive income and equity.

Hence, the Group is not significantly \\nexposed to interest rate risk. Notes forming part of Consolidated Financial Statements\\nIntegrated Annual Report 2023-24201 Consolidated Financial Statements 2023-24\\n Credit risk\\n Credit risk is the risk of financial loss arising fr\\nom counterparty failure to repay or service debt according to the contractual terms \\nor obligations. Credit risk encompasses of both, the direct risk of default and the risk of deterioration of creditworthiness as well \\nas concentration of risks. Credit risk is controlled by analysing credit limits and creditworthiness of customers on a continuous \\nbasis to whom the credit has been granted after obtaining necessary approvals for credit. Refer note 5 for methods, assumptions \\nand information used to measure expected credit losses.\\n Financial instrumen\\nts that are subject to credit risk consist of trade receivables, loans, investments, derivative financial \\ninstruments, cash and cash equivalents, bank deposits and other financial assets. Inter-corporate deposits of `170 crore are with \\na financial institution having a high credit-rating assigned by credit-rating agencies. Bank deposits include an amount of `5,197 \\ncrore held with two banks having high credit rating which are individually in excess of 10% or more of the Group’s total bank \\ndeposits as at March 31, 2024. None of the other financial instruments of the Group result in material concentration of credit risk.\\n • Exposure t\\no credit risk\\n  The carr\\nying amount of financial assets and contract assets represents the maximum credit exposure. The maximum \\nexposure to credit risk was `2,96,130 crore and `1,09,258 crore as at March 31, 2024 and 2023, respectively, being the total \\nof the carrying amount of balances with banks, bank deposits, investments, trade receivables, loans, contract assets and \\nother financial assets.\\n  The Group’\\ns exposure to customers is diversified and no single customer contributes to more than 10% of outstanding trade \\nreceivables and contract assets as at March 31, 2024 and 2023.\\n • Geographic c\\noncentration of credit risk\\n  Geographic c\\noncentration of trade receivables (gross and net of allowances) and contract assets is as follows:\\nAs at March 31, 2024 As at March 31, 2023\\nGross% Net% Gross% Net%\\nUnited States of America  42.07  42.67  43.65  44.31 \\nIndia  18.68  17.44  15.45  14.06 \\nUnited Kingdom  16.56  16.86  16.05  16.37 \\n  Geographic\\nal concentration of trade receivables (gross and net of allowances) and contract assets is allocated based on the \\nlocation of the customers.\\n  The allow\\nance for lifetime expected credit losses on trade receivables for the years ended March 31, 2024 and 2023, was \\n`98 crore and `126 crore respectively.

The cost of the right-of-use asset measured at inception shall comprise of the amount of the initial \\nmeasurement of the lease liability adjusted for any lease payments made at or before the commencement date less any lease \\nincentives received, plus any initial direct costs incurred and an estimate of costs to be incurred by the lessee in dismantling \\nand removing the underlying asset or restoring the underlying asset or site on which it is located. The right-of-use asset is \\nsubsequently measured at cost less any accumulated depreciation, accumulated impairment losses, if any and adjusted \\nfor any remeasurement of the lease liability. The right-of-use asset is depreciated using the straight-line method from the \\ncommencement date over the shorter of lease term or useful life of right-of-use asset. The estimated useful lives of right-of-use \\nassets are determined on the same basis as those of property, plant and equipment. Right-of-use assets are tested for impairment \\nwhenever there is any indication that their carrying amounts may not be recoverable. Impairment loss, if any, is recognised in the \\nstatement of profit and loss. Notes forming part of Consolidated Financial Statements\\nIntegrated Annual Report 2023-24205 Consolidated Financial Statements 2023-24\\n The Group measures the lease liability at the present value of the lease payments that are not paid at the commencement \\nda\\nte of the lease. The lease payments are discounted using the interest rate implicit in the lease, if that rate can be readily \\ndetermined. If that rate cannot be readily determined, the Group uses incremental borrowing rate. For leases with reasonably \\nsimilar characteristics, the Group, on a lease-by-lease basis, may adopt either the incremental borrowing rate specific to the lease \\nor the incremental borrowing rate for the portfolio as a whole. The lease payments shall include fixed payments, variable lease \\npayments, residual value guarantees, exercise price of a purchase option where the Group is reasonably certain to exercise that \\noption and payments of penalties for terminating the lease, if the lease term reflects the lessee exercising an option to terminate \\nthe lease. The lease liability is subsequently remeasured by increasing the carrying amount to reflect interest on the lease \\nliability, reducing the carrying amount to reflect the lease payments made and remeasuring the carrying amount to reflect any \\nreassessment or lease modifications or to reflect revised in-substance fixed lease payments. The Group recognises the amount \\nof the re-measurement of lease liability due to modification as an adjustment to the right-of-use asset and statement of profit \\nand loss depending upon the nature of modification. Where the carrying amount of the right-of-use asset is reduced to zero \\nand there is a further reduction in the measurement of the lease liability, the Group recognises any remaining amount of the re-\\nmeasurement in statement of profit and loss.\\n The Group has elect\\ned not to apply the requirements of Ind AS 116 - Leases to short-term leases of all assets that have a lease \\nterm of 12 months or less and leases for which the underlying asset is of low value. The lease payments associated with these \\nleases are recognised as an expense on a straight-line basis over the lease term.\\n Group as a lessor\\n At the incep\\ntion of the lease the Group classifies each of its leases as either an operating lease or a finance lease. The Group \\nrecognises lease payments received under operating leases as income on a straight-line basis over the lease term. In case of a \\nfinance lease, finance income is recognised over the lease term based on a pattern reflecting a constant periodic rate of return on \\nthe lessor’s net investment in the lease. When the Group is an intermediate lessor it accounts for its interests in the head lease \\nand the sub-lease separately. It assesses the lease classification of a sub-lease with reference to the right-of-use asset arising from \\nthe head lease, not with reference to the underlying asset. If a head lease is a short-term lease to which the Group applies the \\nexemption described above, then it classifies the sub-lease as an operating lease. \\n If an arrang\\nement contains lease and non-lease components, the Group applies Ind AS 115 - Revenue from contracts with \\ncustomers to allocate the consideration in the contract.\\n The det\\nails of the right-of-use assets held by the Group is as follows:\\n(` crore)\\nAdditions for  \\nthe year ended \\nMarch 31, 2024Net carrying  \\namount as at  \\nMarch 31, 2024\\nLeasehold land  -     929 \\nBuildings  1,928  6,631 \\nLeasehold improvements  -     25 \\nComputer equipment  125  202 \\nSoftware licences  -     60 \\nVehicles  18  34 \\nOffice equipment  1  3 \\nFurniture and fixtures  2  2 \\n 2,074  7,886  Notes forming part of Consolidated Financial Statements\\nIntegrated Annual Report 2023-24206 Consolidated Financial Statements 2023-24\\n(` crore)\\nAdditions for  \\nthe year ended \\nMarch 31, 2023Net carrying  \\namount as at  \\nMarch 31, 2023\\nLeasehold land  179  940 \\nBuildings  1,236  6,330 \\nLeasehold improvements  14  30 \\nComputer equipment  73  125 \\nSoftware licences  -     96 \\nVehicles  17  34 \\nOffice equipment  1  5 \\n 1,520  7,560 \\n Deprecia\\ntion on right-of-use assets is as follows:\\n(` crore)\\nYear ended  \\nMarch 31, 2024Year ended  \\nMarch 31, 2023\\nLeasehold land 11  10 \\nBuildings 1,593  1,530 \\nLeasehold improvements  8  6 \\nComputer equipment  47  32 \\nSoftware licences 36  37 \\nVehicles  18  16 \\nOffice equipment  3  3 \\nFurniture and fixtures -*  -    \\n1,716  1,634 \\n *Repr\\nesents value less than `0.50 crore.\\n Int\\nerest on lease liabilities is `518 crore and `492 crore for the years ended March 31, 2024 and 2023, respectively.\\n The Group incurr\\ned `353 crore and `318 crore for the years ended March 31, 2024 and 2023, respectively, towards expenses \\nrelating to short-term leases and leases of low-value assets.\\n The tot\\nal cash outflow for leases is `2,515 crore and `2,538 crore for the years ended March 31, 2024 and 2023, respectively, \\nincluding cash outflow for short term leases and leases of low-value assets.\\n The Group has lease t\\nerm extension options that are not reflected in the measurement of lease liabilities.

The Group offers a consulting-\\nled, cognitive powered, integrated portfolio of IT, business and engineering services and solutions.\\n  Re\\nvenue is recognised upon transfer of control of promised products or services to customers in an amount that reflects the \\nconsideration which the Group expects to receive in exchange for those products or services.\\n • Re\\nvenue from time and material and job contracts is recognised on output basis measured by units delivered, efforts \\nexpended, number of transactions processed, etc. \\n • Re\\nvenue related to fixed price maintenance and support services contracts where the Group is standing ready to provide \\nservices is recognised based on time elapsed mode and revenue is straight lined over the period of performance.\\n • In respect of other fix\\ned-price contracts, revenue is recognised using percentage-of-completion method (‘POC method’) of \\naccounting with contract costs incurred determining the degree of completion of the performance obligation. The contract \\ncosts used in computing the revenues include cost of fulfilling warranty obligations.  \\n • Re\\nvenue from the sale of distinct internally developed software and manufactured systems and third party software \\nis recognised upfront at the point in time when the system / software is delivered to the customer. In cases where \\nimplementation and / or customisation services rendered significantly modifies or customises the software, these services \\nand software are accounted for as a single performance obligation and revenue is recognised over time on a POC method . \\n • Re\\nvenue from the sale of distinct third party hardware is recognised at the point in time when control is transferred to the \\ncustomer. \\n • The solutions offer\\ned by the Group may include supply of third-party equipment or software. In such cases, revenue for \\nsupply of such third party products are recorded at gross or net basis depending on whether the Group is acting as the \\nprincipal or as an agent of the customer. The Group recognises revenue in the gross amount of consideration when it is \\nacting as a principal and at net amount of consideration when it is acting as an agent.  \\n Re\\nvenue is measured based on the transaction price, which is the consideration, adjusted for volume discounts, service level \\ncredits, performance bonuses, price concessions and incentives, if any, as specified in the contract with the customer. Revenue \\nalso excludes taxes collected from customers.\\n The Group’\\ns contracts with customers could include promises to transfer multiple products and services to a customer. The \\nGroup assesses the products / services promised in a contract and identifies distinct performance obligations in the contract. \\nIdentification of distinct performance obligation involves judgement to determine the deliverables and the ability of the customer \\nto benefit independently from such deliverables.\\n Judgemen\\nt is also required to determine the transaction price for the contract and to ascribe the transaction price to each \\ndistinct performance obligation. The transaction price could be either a fixed amount of customer consideration or variable \\nconsideration with elements such as volume discounts, service level credits, performance bonuses, price concessions and \\nincentives. The transaction price is also adjusted for the effects of the time value of money if the contract includes a significant \\nfinancing component. Any consideration payable to the customer is adjusted to the transaction price, unless it is a payment for \\na distinct product or service from the customer. The estimated amount of variable consideration is adjusted in the transaction \\nprice only to the extent that it is highly probable that a significant reversal in the amount of cumulative revenue recognised will not occur and is reassessed at the end of each reporting period. The Group allocates the elements of variable considerations \\nto all the performance obligations of the contract unless there is observable evidence that they pertain to one or more distinct \\nperformance obligations.\\n The Group e\\nxercises judgement in determining whether the performance obligation is satisfied at a point in time or over a period \\nof time. The Group considers indicators such as how customer consumes benefits as services are rendered or who controls \\nthe asset as it is being created or existence of enforceable right to payment for performance to date and alternate use of such \\nproduct or service, transfer of significant risks and rewards to the customer, acceptance of delivery by the customer, etc.\\n Contr\\nact fulfilment costs are generally expensed as incurred except for certain software licence costs which meet the criteria for \\ncapitalisation. Such costs are amortised over the contractual period or useful life of licence, whichever is less. The assessment of \\nthis criteria requires the application of judgement, in particular when considering if costs generate or enhance resources to be \\nused to satisfy future performance obligations and whether costs are expected to be recovered. Notes forming part of Consolidated Financial Statements\\nIntegrated Annual Report 2023-24215 Consolidated Financial Statements 2023-24\\n Contract assets are recognised when there are excess of revenues earned over billings on contracts. Contract assets are classified \\nas unbilled r\\neceivables (only act of invoicing is pending) when there is unconditional right to receive cash, and only passage of \\ntime is required, as per contractual terms. \\n Unearned and def\\nerred revenue (“contract liability”) is recognised when there are billings in excess of revenues.\\n The billing schedules agreed with cus\\ntomers include periodic performance based payments and / or milestone based progress \\npayments. Invoices are payable within contractually agreed credit period.\\n In accor\\ndance with Ind AS 37, the Group recognises an onerous contract provision when the unavoidable costs of meeting the \\nobligations under a contract exceed the economic benefits to be received. \\n Contr\\nacts are subject to modification to account for changes in contract specification and requirements. The Group reviews \\nmodification to contract in conjunction with the original contract, basis which the transaction price could be allocated to a new \\nperformance obligation, or transaction price of an existing obligation could undergo a change. In the event transaction price is revised for existing obligation, a cumulative adjustment is accounted for.\\n The Group disag\\ngregates revenue from contracts with customers by nature of services, industry verticals and geography.\\n Re\\nvenue disaggregation by nature of services is as follows:\\n(` crore)\\nYear ended  \\nMarch 31, 2024Year ended  \\nMarch 31, 2023\\nConsultancy services 2,38,135 2,23,332\\nSale of equipment and software licences  2,758  2,126 \\n2,40,893 2,25,458\\n Re\\nvenue disaggregation by industry vertical and geography has been included in segment information (Refer note 19).\\n While disclosing the aggr\\negate amount of transaction price yet to be recognised as revenue towards unsatisfied (or partially \\nsatisfied) performance obligations, along with the broad time band for the expected time to recognise those revenues, the \\nGroup has applied the practical expedient in Ind AS 115. Accordingly, the Group has not disclosed the aggregate transaction price \\nallocated to unsatisfied (or partially satisfied) performance obligations which pertain to contracts where revenue recognised \\ncorresponds to the value transferred to customer typically involving time and material, outcome based and event based contracts. \\n Unsatis\\nfied (or partially satisfied) performance obligations are subject to variability due to several factors such as terminations, \\nchanges in scope of contracts, periodic revalidations of the estimates, economic factors (changes in currency rates, tax laws etc). \\nThe aggregate value of transaction price allocated to unsatisfied (or partially satisfied) performance obligations is `1,65,314 crore \\nout of which 47.69% is expected to be recognised as revenue in the next year and the balance thereafter.

Remeasurement, comprising actuarial gains and losses, the effect of the \\nchanges to the asset ceiling and the return on plan assets (excluding interest), is reflected immediately in the balance sheet with \\na charge or credit recognised in other comprehensive income in the period in which they occur. Past service cost, both vested and \\nunvested, is recognised as an expense at the earlier of (a) when the plan amendment or curtailment occurs; and (b) when the \\nentity recognises related restructuring costs or termination benefits. \\n The re\\ntirement benefit obligations recognised in the balance sheet represents the present value of the defined benefit obligations \\nreduced by the fair value of scheme assets.

The contributions made by the Company and the shortfall of interest, if any, are recognised as an expense in profit and loss under employee benefit expenses. In accordance with an actuarial valuation of provident fund \\nliabilities on the basis of guidance issued by Actuarial Society of India and based on the assumptions as mentioned below, there \\nis no deficiency in the interest cost as the present value of the expected future earnings of the fund is greater than the expected \\namount to be credited to the individual members based on the expected guaranteed rate of interest of Government administered \\nprovident fund.\\n All eligible employ\\nees of Indian subsidiaries of the Company are entitled to receive benefits under the provident fund plan in \\nwhich both the employee and employer (at a determined rate) contribute monthly to the Government administered provident \\nfund plan.

We believe that the audit evidence we have obtained is sufficient and appropriate to provide a basis for our opinion on the standalone financial statements.\\nKey Audit Matter(s)\\nKey audit matters are those matters that, in our professional judgment, were of most significance in our audit of the standalone financial statements of the current period. These matters were addressed in the context of our audit of the standalone financial statements as a whole, and in forming our opinion thereon, and we do not provide a separate opinion on these matters.\\nRevenue recognition– Fixed price contracts where revenue is recognized using percentage of completion method\\nRefer Note 4(a) and 10 to the standalone financial statements\\nThe key audit matter How the matter was addressed in our audit\\nThe Company inter alia engages in Fixed-price \\ncontracts, wherein, revenue is recognized using the percentage of completion computed as per the input method based on the Company’s estimate of contract costs.\\nWe identified revenue recognition of fixed price \\ncontracts where the percentage of completion is used as a key audit matter since -\\n•\\n there is an inher\\nent risk and presumed fraud \\nrisk around the accuracy and existence \\nof revenues recognised considering the customised and complex nature of these contracts and significant inputs of IT systems;Our audit procedures included the following:\\n•\\n Obt\\nained an understanding of the systems, processes and controls \\nimplemented by the Company for recording and computing revenue and \\nthe associated contract assets, unearned and deferred revenue balances.\\n• Inv\\nolvement of our Information technology (‘IT’) specialists, as required:\\n \\uf0d8  Assessed the IT envir\\nonment in which the business systems operate \\nand tested system controls over computation of revenue recognised;\\n \\uf0d8  Tes\\nted the IT controls over appropriateness of cost and revenue \\nreports generated by the system;\\n \\uf0d8  Tes\\nted the controls pertaining to allocation of resources and \\nbudgeting systems which prevent the unauthorized recording/\\nchanges to costs incurred; and\\n Integrated Annual Report 2023-24242 Standalone Financial Statements\\nThe key audit matter How the matter was addressed in our audit\\n• applica\\ntion of revenue recognition accounting \\nstandard (Ind AS 115, Revenue from Contracts \\nwith customers) is complex and involves a number of key judgments and estimates in mainly identifying performance obligations, related transaction price and estimating the future cost-to- completion of these contracts, which is used to determine the percentage of completion of the relevant performance obligation;\\n•\\n these con\\ntracts may involve onerous \\nobligations which requires critical assessment of foreseeable losses to be made by the Company; and\\n•\\n at y\\near-end, significant amount of work in \\nprogress (Contract assets), related to these contracts are recognised on the balance sheet. \\uf0d8  Tes\\nted on a random sampling basis the controls relating to the \\nestimation of contract costs required to complete the respective projects.\\n•\\n On selected specific and s\\ntatistical samples of contracts, we tested that \\nthe revenue recognized is in accordance with the revenue recognition accounting standard including –\\n \\uf0d8  Ev\\naluated the identification of performance obligations and the \\nascribed transaction price;\\n \\uf0d8  For t\\nesting the Company’s computation of the estimation of contract \\ncosts and onerous obligations, if any.

The other information comprises the information included in the Company’s annual report, but does not include the financial statements and auditor’s report(s) thereon. The Company’s annual report is expected to be made available to us after the date of this auditor’s report.\\nOur opinion on the standalone financial statements does not \\ncover the other information and we will not express any form of assurance conclusion thereon.\\nIn connection with our audit of the standalone financial \\nstatements, our responsibility is to read the other information identified above when it becomes available and, in doing so, consider whether the other information is materially inconsistent with the standalone financial statements or our knowledge obtained in the audit, or otherwise appears to be materially misstated.\\nManagement’s and Board of Directors’ Responsibilities for the \\nStandalone Financial Statements\\nThe Company’s Management and Board of Directors are responsible for the matters stated in Section 134(5) of the Act with respect to the preparation of these standalone financial statements that give a true and fair view of the state of affairs, profit/ loss and other comprehensive income, changes in equity and cash flows of the Company in accordance with the accounting principles generally accepted in India, including the Indian Accounting Standards (Ind AS) specified under Section 133 of the Act. This responsibility also includes maintenance of adequate accounting records in accordance with the provisions of the Act for safeguarding of the assets of the Company and for preventing and detecting frauds and other irregularities; \\nselection and application of appropriate accounting policies; making judgments and estimates that are reasonable and prudent; and design, implementation and maintenance of adequate internal financial controls, that were operating effectively for ensuring the accuracy and completeness of the accounting records, relevant to the preparation and presentation of the standalone financial statements that give a true and fair view and are free from material misstatement, whether due to fraud or error.\\nIn preparing the standalone financial statements, the \\nManagement and Board of Directors are responsible for assessing the Company’s ability to continue as a going concern, disclosing, as applicable, matters related to going concern and using the going concern basis of accounting unless the Board of Directors either intends to liquidate the Company or to cease operations, or has no realistic alternative but to do so.\\nThe Board of Directors is also responsible for overseeing the \\nCompany’s financial reporting process.\\nAuditor’s Responsibilities for the Audit of the Standalone \\nFinancial Statements\\nOur objectives are to obtain reasonable assurance about whether the standalone financial statements as a whole are free from material misstatement, whether due to fraud or error, and to issue an auditor’s report that includes our opinion. Reasonable assurance is a high level of assurance, but is not a guarantee that an audit conducted in accordance with SAs will always detect a material misstatement when it exists. Misstatements can arise from fraud or error and are considered material if, individually or in the aggregate, they could reasonably be expected to influence the economic decisions of users taken on the basis of these standalone financial statements. Integrated Annual Report 2023-24243 Standalone Financial Statements\\nAs part of an audit in accordance with SAs, we exercise \\nprofessional judgment and maintain professional skepticism throughout the audit. We also:\\n•\\n Identif\\ny and assess the risks of material misstatement of \\nthe standalone financial statements, whether due to fraud \\nor error, design and perform audit procedures responsive to those risks, and obtain audit evidence that is sufficient and appropriate to provide a basis for our opinion. The risk of not detecting a material misstatement resulting from fraud is higher than for one resulting from error, as fraud may involve collusion, forgery, intentional omissions, misrepresentations, or the override of internal control.\\n•\\n Obt\\nain an understanding of internal control relevant to \\nthe audit in order to design audit procedures that are appropriate in the circumstances. Under Section 143(3)(i)  \\nof the Act, we are also responsible for expressing our opinion on whether the company has adequate internal financial controls with reference to financial statements in place and the operating effectiveness of such controls.\\n•\\n Ev\\naluate the appropriateness of accounting policies used \\nand the reasonableness of accounting estimates and related disclosures made by the Management and Board of Directors.\\n•\\n Conclude on the appropria\\nteness of the Management \\nand Board of Directors use of the going concern basis of accounting in preparation of standalone financial statements and, based on the audit evidence obtained, whether a material uncertainty exists related to events or conditions that may cast significant doubt on the Company’s ability to continue as a going concern. If we conclude that a material uncertainty exists, we are required to draw attention in our auditor’s report to the related disclosures in the standalone financial statements or, if such disclosures are inadequate, to modify our opinion. Our conclusions are based on the audit evidence obtained up to the date of our auditor’s report. However, future events or conditions may cause the Company to cease to continue as a going concern.\\n•\\n Ev\\naluate the overall presentation, structure and content \\nof the standalone financial statements, including the disclosures, and whether the standalone financial statements represent the underlying transactions and events in a manner that achieves fair presentation.\\nWe communicate with those charged with governance regarding, among other matters, the planned scope and timing of the audit and significant audit findings, including any significant deficiencies in internal control that we identify during our audit.\\nWe also provide those charged with governance with a \\nstatement that we have complied with relevant ethical requirements regarding independence, and to communicate with them all relationships and other matters that may reasonably be thought to bear on our independence, and where applicable, related safeguards.\\nFrom the matters communicated with those charged with \\ngovernance, we determine those matters that were of most significance in the audit of the standalone financial statements of the current period and are therefore the key audit matters. We describe these matters in our auditor’s report unless law or regulation precludes public disclosure about the matter or when, in extremely rare circumstances, we determine that a matter should not be communicated in our report because the adverse consequences of doing so would reasonably be expected to outweigh the public interest benefits of such communication.\\nReport on Other Legal and Regulatory Requirements\\n1.\\n As requir\\ned by the Companies (Auditor’s Report) Order, \\n2020 (“the Order”) issued by the Central Government of India in terms of Section 143(11) of the Act, we give in the “Annexure A” a statement on the matters specified in paragraphs 3 and 4 of the Order, to the extent applicable.\\n2.\\n  A.

These responsibilities include the design, implementation and maintenance of adequate internal financial controls that were operating effectively for ensuring the orderly and efficient conduct of its business, including adherence to company’s policies, the safeguarding of its assets, the prevention and detection of frauds and errors, the accuracy and completeness of the accounting records, and the timely preparation of reliable financial information, as required under the Act.\\nAuditors’ Responsibility\\nOur responsibility is to express an opinion on the Company’s internal financial controls with reference to financial statements based on our audit. We conducted our audit in accordance with the Guidance Note and the Standards on Auditing, prescribed under Section 143(10) of the Act, to the extent applicable to an audit of internal financial controls with reference to financial statements. Those Standards and the Guidance Note require that we comply with ethical requirements and plan and perform the audit to obtain reasonable assurance about whether adequate internal financial controls with reference to financial statements were established and maintained and if such controls operated effectively in all material respects.\\nOur audit involves performing procedures to obtain audit \\nevidence about the adequacy of the internal financial controls with reference to financial statements and their operating effectiveness. Our audit of internal financial controls with reference to financial statements included obtaining an understanding of internal financial controls with reference to financial statements, assessing the risk that a material weakness exists, and testing and evaluating the design and operating effectiveness of internal control based on the assessed risk. The procedures selected depend on the auditor’s judgement, including the assessment of the risks of material misstatement of the standalone financial statements, whether due to fraud or error.\\nWe believe that the audit evidence we have obtained is \\nsufficient and appropriate to provide a basis for our audit opinion on the Company’s internal financial controls with reference to financial statements.\\nMeaning of Internal Financial Controls with Reference to \\nFinancial StatementsA company’s internal financial controls with reference to financial statements is a process designed to provide reasonable assurance regarding the reliability of financial reporting and the preparation of financial statements for external purposes in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles. A company’s internal financial controls with reference to financial statements include those policies and procedures that (1) pertain to the maintenance of records that, in reasonable detail, accurately and fairly reflect the transactions and dispositions of the assets of the company; (2) provide reasonable assurance that transactions are recorded as necessary to permit preparation of financial statements in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles, and that receipts and expenditures of the company are being made only in accordance with authorisations of management and directors of the company; and (3) provide reasonable assurance regarding prevention or timely detection of unauthorised acquisition, use, or disposition of the company’s assets that could have a material effect on the financial statements.\\nInherent Limitations of Internal Financial Controls with \\nReference to Financial StatementsBecause of the inherent limitations of internal financial controls with reference to financial statements, including the possibility of collusion or improper management override of controls, material misstatements due to error or fraud may occur and not be detected. Also, projections of any evaluation of the internal financial controls with reference to financial statements to future periods are subject to the risk that the internal financial controls with reference to financial statements may become inadequate because of changes in conditions, or that the degree of compliance with the policies or procedures may deteriorate. \\nFor B S R & Co.

The Company offers a consulting-led, cognitive powered, integrated portfolio of IT, business and engineering services and solutions. This is delivered through its unique Location-Independent Agile delivery model recognised as a benchmark of excellence in software development.\\n The Company is a public limit\\ned company incorporated and \\ndomiciled in India. The address of its corporate office is TCS House, Raveline Street, Fort, Mumbai - 400001. As at  March 31, 2024, Tata Sons Private Limited, the holding company owned 71.74% of the Company’s equity share capital.\\n The Board of Dir\\nectors approved the standalone financial \\nstatements for the year ended March 31, 2024 and authorised for issue on April 12, 2024.\\n2)\\n Sta\\ntement of compliance\\n These st\\nandalone financial statements have been prepared \\nin accordance with the Indian Accounting Standards (referred to as “Ind AS”) as prescribed under section 133 of the Companies Act, 2013 read with the Companies (Indian Accounting Standards) Rules as amended from time to time.\\n3)\\n Basis of prepar\\nation\\n These st\\nandalone financial statements have been prepared \\non historical cost basis except for certain financial instruments and defined benefit plans which are measured at fair value or amortised cost at the end of each reporting period. Historical cost is generally based on the fair value of the consideration given in exchange for goods and services. Fair value is the price that would be received to sell an asset or paid to transfer a liability in an orderly transaction between market participants at the measurement date. All assets and liabilities have been classified as current and non-current as per the Company’s normal operating cycle. Based on the nature of services rendered to customers and time elapsed between deployment of resources and the realisation in cash and cash equivalents of the consideration for such services rendered, the Company has considered an operating cycle of 12 months.\\n The st\\natement of cash flows has been prepared under \\nindirect method, whereby profit or loss is adjusted for the effects of transactions of a non-cash nature, any deferrals or accruals of past or future operating cash receipts or payments and items of income or expense associated with investing or financing cash flows. The cash flows from operating, investing and financing activities of the Company are segregated. The Company considers all highly liquid investments that are readily convertible to known amounts of cash and are subject to an insignificant risk of changes in value to be cash equivalents.\\n These st\\nandalone financial statements have been prepared \\nin Indian Rupee ( `) which is the functional currency of the Company. Foreign currency transactions are recorded at exchange rates prevailing on the date of the transaction. Foreign currency denominated monetary assets and liabilities are retranslated at the exchange rate prevailing on the balance sheet dates and exchange gains and losses arising on settlement and restatement are recognised in the statement of profit and loss. Non-monetary assets and liabilities that are measured in terms of historical cost in foreign currencies are not retranslated.\\n The mat\\nerial accounting policy information related to \\npreparation of the standalone financial statements have been discussed in the respective notes.\\n4)\\n Use of estima\\ntes and judgements  \\n The prepar\\nation of standalone financial statements \\nin conformity with the recognition and measurement principles of Ind AS requires management of the Company to make estimates and judgements that affect the reported balances of assets and liabilities, disclosures of contingent liabilities as at the date of standalone financial statements and the reported amounts of income and expenses for the periods presented.\\n Estima\\ntes and underlying assumptions are reviewed on \\nan ongoing basis. Revisions to accounting estimates are recognised in the period in which the estimates are revised and future periods are affected.\\n The Company uses the f\\nollowing critical accounting \\njudgements, estimates and assumptions in preparation of its standalone financial statements:\\n (a) Re\\nvenue recognition\\n  Re\\nvenue for fixed-price contracts is recognised using \\npercentage-of-completion method. The Company estimates the future cost-to-completion of the contracts which is used to determine degree of completion of the performance obligation.\\n  The Company e\\nxercises judgement for identification of \\nperformance obligations, determination of transaction price, ascribing the transaction price to each distinct performance obligation and in determining whether the performance obligation is satisfied at a point in time or over a period of time. These judgements have been explained in detail under the revenue note (Refer note 10).\\n (b) Useful liv\\nes of property, plant and equipment\\n  The Company r\\neviews the useful life of property, \\nplant and equipment at the end of each reporting period. This reassessment may result in change in depreciation expense in future periods (Refer note 8(a)).\\n (c) Impairment of in\\nvestments in subsidiaries\\n  The Company r\\neviews its carrying value of investments \\ncarried at cost (net of impairment, if any) annually, or more frequently when there is indication for impairment. If the recoverable amount is less than its carrying amount, the impairment loss is accounted for in the statement of profit and loss. Notes forming part of Standalone Financial Statements\\nIntegrated Annual Report 2023-24257 Standalone Financial Statements 2023-24\\n (d) Fair value measurement of financial instruments\\n  When the fair v\\nalue of financial assets and financial \\nliabilities recorded in the balance sheet cannot be \\nmeasured based on quoted prices in active markets, their fair value is measured using valuation techniques including the Discounted Cash Flow model. The inputs to these models are taken from observable markets where possible, but where this is not feasible, a degree of judgement is required in establishing fair values. Judgements include considerations of inputs such as liquidity risk, credit risk and volatility. Changes in assumptions about these factors could affect the reported fair value of financial instruments.\\n (e) \\n Impairment of financial asse\\nts (other than at fair \\nvalue)\\n  Measuremen\\nt of impairment of financial assets \\nrequire use of estimates, which have been explained in the note on financial assets, financial liabilities and equity instruments, under impairment of financial assets (other than at fair value) (Refer note 6).\\n (f) Pro\\nvision for income tax and deferred tax assets\\n  The Company uses judg\\nements based on the relevant \\nrulings in the areas of allocation of revenue, costs, allowances and disallowances which is exercised while determining the provision for income tax. A deferred tax asset is recognised to the extent that it is probable that future taxable profit will be available against which the deductible temporary differences and tax losses can be utilised. Accordingly, the Company exercises its judgement to reassess the carrying amount of deferred tax assets at the end of each reporting period.\\n (g) Pro\\nvisions and contingent liabilities\\n  The Company es\\ntimates the provisions that have \\npresent obligations as a result of past events and it is probable that outflow of resources will be required to settle the obligations. These provisions are reviewed at the end of each reporting period and are adjusted to reflect the current best estimates. \\n  The Company uses signific\\nant judgements to assess \\ncontingent liabilities. Contingent liabilities are disclosed when there is a possible obligation arising from past events, the existence of which will be confirmed only by the occurrence or non-occurrence of one or more uncertain future events not wholly within the control of the Company or a present obligation that arises from past events where it is either not probable that an outflow of resources will be required to settle the obligation or a reliable estimate of the amount cannot be made. Contingent assets are neither recognised nor disclosed in the standalone financial statements.\\n (h) Employ\\nee benefits\\n  The accoun\\nting of employee benefit plans in the \\nnature of defined benefit requires the Company to use assumptions. These assumptions have been explained under employee benefits note (Refer note 12). (i) Leases\\n  The Company e\\nvaluates if an arrangement qualifies \\nto be a lease as per the requirements of Ind AS 116. \\nIdentification of a lease requires significant judgement. The Company uses significant judgement in assessing the lease term (including anticipated renewals) and the applicable discount rate. \\n  The Company de\\ntermines the lease term as the \\nnon-cancellable period of a lease, together with both periods covered by an option to extend the lease if the Company is reasonably certain to exercise that option; and periods covered by an option to terminate the lease if the Company is reasonably certain not to exercise that option. In assessing whether the Company is reasonably certain to exercise an option to extend a lease, or not to exercise an option to terminate a lease, it considers all relevant facts and circumstances that create an economic incentive for the Company to exercise the option to extend the lease, or not to exercise the option to terminate the lease. The Company revises the lease term if there is a change in the non-cancellable period of a lease.\\n  The discoun\\nt rate is generally based on the \\nincremental borrowing rate specific to the lease being evaluated or for a portfolio of leases with similar characteristics.\\n5)\\n Recen\\nt pronouncements\\n Ministr\\ny of Corporate Affairs (“MCA”) notifies new \\nstandards or amendments to the existing standards under Companies (Indian Accounting Standards) Rules as issued from time to time. For the year ended March 31, 2024, MCA has not notified any new standards or amendments to the existing standards applicable to the Company.\\n6)\\n \\n Financial assets, financial liabilities and equity ins\\ntruments\\n Financial assets and liabilities ar\\ne recognised when the \\nCompany becomes a party to the contractual provisions of \\nthe instrument. Financial assets and liabilities are initially measured at fair value, except for trade receivables which are initially measured at transaction price. Transaction costs that are directly attributable to the acquisition or issue of financial assets and financial liabilities (other than financial assets and financial liabilities at fair value through profit or loss) are added to or deducted from the fair value measured on initial recognition of financial asset or financial liability.\\n The Company der\\necognises a financial asset only when the \\ncontractual rights to the cash flows from the asset expire, or when it transfers the financial asset and substantially all the risks and rewards of ownership of the asset to another entity. The Company derecognises financial liabilities when, and only when, the Company’s obligations are discharged, \\ncancelled or have expired.\\n Cash and cash equiv\\nalents\\n The Company c\\nonsiders all highly liquid investments, which \\nare readily convertible into known amounts of cash that are \\nsubject to an insignificant risk of change in value, to be cash  Notes forming part of Standalone Financial Statements\\nIntegrated Annual Report 2023-24258 Standalone Financial Statements 2023-24\\nequivalents. Cash and cash equivalents consist of balances \\nwith banks which are unrestricted for withdrawal and usage.\\n Financial assets a\\nt amortised cost\\n Financial assets ar\\ne subsequently measured at amortised \\ncost if these financial assets are held within a business \\nwhose objective is to hold these assets in order to collect contractual cash flows and the contractual terms of the financial assets give rise on specified dates to cash flows that are solely payments of principal and interest on the principal amount outstanding.\\n  Financial assets a\\nt fair value through other \\ncomprehensive income\\n Financial assets ar\\ne measured at fair value through other \\ncomprehensive income if these financial assets are held within a business whose objective is achieved by both collecting contractual cash flows on specified dates that are solely payments of principal and interest on the principal amount outstanding and selling financial assets.\\n The Company has made an irr\\nevocable election to present \\nsubsequent changes in the fair value of equity investments not held for trading in other comprehensive income.\\n Financial assets a\\nt fair value through profit or loss\\n Financial assets ar\\ne measured at fair value through profit \\nor loss unless they are measured at amortised cost or at fair value through other comprehensive income on initial recognition. The transaction costs directly attributable to the acquisition of financial assets and liabilities at fair value through profit or loss are immediately recognised in statement of profit and loss.\\n Inv\\nestment in subsidiaries\\n Inv\\nestment in subsidiaries are measured at cost less \\nimpairment loss, if any.\\n Financial liabilities\\n Financial liabilities are measur\\ned at amortised cost using \\nthe effective interest method.\\n Equity ins\\ntruments\\n An equity instrumen\\nt is a contract that evidences residual \\ninterest in the assets of the company after deducting all of its liabilities. Equity instruments issued by the Company are recognised at the proceeds received net of direct issue cost.\\n Deriva\\ntive accounting\\n • Instrumen\\nts in hedging relationship\\n  The Company designa\\ntes certain foreign exchange \\nforward, currency options and futures contracts as \\nhedge instruments in respect of foreign exchange risks. These hedges are accounted for as cash flow hedges.\\n  The Company uses hedging ins\\ntruments that are \\ngoverned by the financial risk management policy as approved by the Risk Management Committee. The policy provides principles on the use of such financial derivatives consistent with the risk management strategy of the Company. While determining the \\nappropriate hedge ratio, the Company takes into consideration the prevailing macro-economic conditions, the availability and liquidity of the hedging instruments, tolerance levels for hedge ineffectiveness and the costs of hedging. The hedging activities are reviewed by the Risk Management Committee every quarter and future course of action is determined.\\n  The hedge ins\\ntruments are designated and \\ndocumented as hedges at the inception of the contract. The Company determines the existence of an economic relationship between the hedging instrument and hedged item based on the currency, amount and timing of their respective cash flows. The effectiveness of hedge instruments to reduce the risk associated with the exposure being hedged is assessed and measured at inception and on an ongoing basis. If the hedged future cash flows are no longer expected to occur, then the amounts that have been accumulated in other equity are immediately reclassified in net foreign exchange gains in the statement of profit and loss.\\n  The eff\\nective portion of change in the fair value of the \\ndesignated hedging instrument is recognised in the other comprehensive income and accumulated under the heading cash flow hedging reserve.\\n  The Company separ\\nates the intrinsic value and \\ntime value of an option and designates as hedging instruments only the change in intrinsic value of the option. The change in fair value of the intrinsic value and time value of an option is recognised in the other comprehensive income and accounted as a separate component of equity. Such amounts are reclassified into the statement of profit and loss when the related hedged items affect profit and loss.\\n  Hedge acc\\nounting is discontinued when the hedging \\ninstrument expires or is sold, terminated or no longer qualifies for hedge accounting. Any gain or loss recognised in other comprehensive income and accumulated in equity till that time remains and is recognised in the statement of profit and loss when the forecasted transaction ultimately affects profit and loss. Any gain or loss is recognised immediately in the statement of profit and loss when the hedge becomes ineffective.\\n • Instrumen\\nts not in hedging relationship\\n  The Company en\\nters into contracts that are effective \\nas hedges from an economic perspective, but they \\ndo not qualify for hedge accounting. The change in the fair value of such instrument is recognised in the statement of profit and loss.\\n Impairment of financial asse\\nts (other than at fair value)\\n The Company assesses a\\nt each date of balance sheet \\nwhether a financial asset or a group of financial assets \\nis impaired. Ind AS 109 requires expected credit losses to be measured through a loss allowance. The Company recognises lifetime expected losses for all contract assets and / or all trade receivables that do not constitute a  Notes forming part of Standalone Financial Statements\\nIntegrated Annual Report 2023-24259 Standalone Financial Statements 2023-24\\nfinancing transaction. In determining the allowance for expected credit losses, the Company has used a practical expedient by \\ncomputing the expected credit loss allowance for trade receivables based on a provision matrix. The provision matrix takes into account historical credit loss experience and is adjusted for forward looking information. The expected credit loss allowance is based on the ageing of the receivables that are due and allowance rates used in the provision matrix. For all other financial assets, expected credit losses are measured at an amount equal to the 12-months expected credit losses or at an amount equal to the \\nlife time expected credit losses if the credit risk on the financial asset has increased significantly since initial recognition.\\n(a)\\n Inv\\nestments\\n Inv\\nestments consist of the following:\\n Inv\\nestments – Non-current\\n(` crore)\\nAs at  \\nMarch 31, 2024As at  \\nMarch 31, 2023\\nInvestment in subsidiaries\\nFully paid equity shares (unquoted)  2,405  2,405 \\nInvestments designated at fair value through OCIFully paid equity shares (unquoted)Taj Air Limited  19  19 \\nLess: Impairment in value of investments  (19)  (19)\\n 2,405  2,405 \\n Inv\\nestments - Current\\n(` crore)\\nAs at  \\nMarch 31, 2024As at  \\nMarch 31, 2023\\nInvestments carried at fair value through profit or lossMutual fund units (quoted)  749  1,147 \\nInvestments carried at fair value through OCIGovernment bonds and securities (quoted)  24,746  26,128 \\nCorporate bonds (quoted)  3,406  3,110 \\nInvestments carried at amortised costCertificate of deposits (quoted)  -     2,955 \\nCommercial papers (quoted)  939  2,398 \\n 29,840  35,738 \\n Gov\\nernment bonds and securities includes bonds pledged with bank for credit facility amounting to NIL and `1,650 crore as at \\nMarch 31, 2024 and 2023, respectively.\\n Aggr\\negate value of quoted and unquoted investments is as follows:\\n(` crore)\\nAs at  \\nMarch 31, 2024As at  \\nMarch 31, 2023\\nAggregate value of quoted investments  29,840  35,738 \\nAggregate value of unquoted investments (net of impairment)  2,405  2,405 \\nAggregate market value of quoted investments  29,841  35,736 \\nAggregate value of impairment of investments  19  19 \\n Marke\\nt value of quoted investments carried at amortised cost is as follows:\\n(` crore)\\nAs at  \\nMarch 31, 2024As at  \\nMarch 31, 2023\\nCertificate of deposits  -     2,951 \\nCommercial papers  940  2,400  Notes forming part of Standalone Financial Statements\\nIntegrated Annual Report 2023-24260 Standalone Financial Statements 2023-24\\n Carrying value of investment in equity instruments is as follows:\\n(` crore)\\nIn Numbers Currency Face value \\nper shareInvestment in subsidiaries As at  \\nMarch 31, 2024As at  \\nMarch 31, 2023\\nFully paid equity shares (unquoted) \\n212,27,83,424 UYU 1 TCS Iberoamerica SA  461  461 \\n15,75,300 INR 10 APTOnline Limited  -     -    \\n1,300 EUR  -    Tata Consultancy Services Belgium  1  1 \\n66,000 EUR  1,000 Tata Consultancy Services  \\nNetherlands BV 403  403 \\n1,000 SEK 100 Tata Consultancy Services Sverige AB  19  19 \\n1 EUR  -    Tata Consultancy Services Deutschland \\nGmbH 2  2 \\n20,000 USD 10 Tata America International Corporation  453  453 \\n75,82,820 SGD 1 Tata Consultancy Services Asia Pacific \\nPte Ltd. 19  19 \\n3,72,58,815 AUD 1 TCS FNS Pty Limited  212  212 \\n10,00,001 GBP 1 Diligenta Limited  429  429 \\n1,000 USD - Tata Consultancy Services Canada Inc. -* -*\\n100 CAD 70,653.61 Tata Consultancy Services Canada Inc.  31  31 \\n51,00,000 INR 10 C-Edge Technologies Limited  5  5 \\n8,90,000 INR 10 MP Online Limited  1  1 \\n1,40,00,000 ZAR 1 Tata Consultancy Services (Africa)  \\n(PTY) Ltd. 66  66 \\n18,89,005 INR 10 MahaOnline Limited  2  2 \\n -    QAR  -    Tata Consultancy Services Qatar L.L.C.  2  2 \\n10,00,000 INR 100 TCS e-Serve International Limited  10  10 \\n1,00,500 GBP 0.00001 Tata Consultancy Services UK Limited  66  66 \\n2,50,00,000 EUR 1 Tata Consultancy Services Ireland Limited 224  224 \\n10,00,000 INR 10 TCS Foundation  -     -    \\n 2,405  2,405 \\n(` crore)\\nIn Numbers Currency Face value \\nper shareEquity instruments designated at fair \\nvalue through OCIAs at  \\nMarch 31, 2024As at  \\nMarch 31, 2023\\nFully paid equity shares (unquoted) \\n1,90,00,000 INR 10 Taj Air Limited  19  19 \\nLess : Impairment in value of investments  (19)  (19)\\n -    -   \\n  *Repr\\nesents value less than `0.50 crore.

Fair values are determined in whole or in \\npart using a valuation model based on assumptions that are neither supported by prices from observable current market transactions in the same instrument nor are they based on available market data.\\n The cos\\nt of unquoted investments included in Level 3 of fair value hierarchy approximate their fair value because there is a wide \\nrange of possible fair value measurements and the cost represents estimate of fair value within that range.

The focus of the risk management committee is to assess the unpredictability of the financial environment and to mitigate potential adverse effects on the financial performance of the Company.\\n Marke\\nt risk\\n Marke\\nt risk is the risk that the fair value or future cash flows of a financial instrument will fluctuate because of changes in market \\nprices. Such changes in the values of financial instruments may result from changes in the foreign currency exchange rates, interest rates, credit, liquidity and other market changes. The Company’s exposure to market risk is primarily on account of foreign currency exchange rate risk.

Considering the countries and economic environment in which the Company operates, its operations are subject to risks arising from fluctuations in exchange rates in those countries. \\n  The Company\\n, as per its risk management policy, uses derivative instruments primarily to hedge foreign exchange. Further, \\nany movement in the functional currency of the various operations of the Company against major foreign currencies may impact the Company’s revenue in international business.\\n  The Company e\\nvaluates the impact of foreign exchange rate fluctuations by assessing its exposure to exchange rate risks. It \\nhedges a part of these risks by using derivative financial instruments in line with its risk management policies.\\n  The for\\neign exchange rate sensitivity is calculated by aggregation of the net foreign exchange rate exposure and a \\nsimultaneous parallel foreign exchange rates shift of all the currencies by 10% against the functional currency of the Company.\\n  The follo\\nwing analysis has been worked out based on the net exposures of the Company as of the date of balance sheet \\nwhich could affect the statement of profit and loss and other comprehensive income and equity.

Hence, the Company is not significantly \\nexposed to interest rate risk.\\n Credit risk\\n Credit risk is the risk of financial loss arising fr\\nom counterparty failure to repay or service debt according to the contractual terms \\nor obligations. Credit risk encompasses of both, the direct risk of default and the risk of deterioration of creditworthiness as well as concentration of risks. Credit risk is controlled by analysing credit limits and creditworthiness of customers on a continuous basis to whom the credit has been granted after obtaining necessary approvals for credit. Refer note 4 for methods, assumptions and information used to measure expected credit losses.\\n Financial instrumen\\nts that are subject to credit risk consist of trade receivables, loans, investments, derivative financial \\ninstruments, cash and cash equivalents, bank deposits and other financial assets. Bank deposits include an amount of `2,500 crore held with two banks having high credit rating which are individually in excess of 10% or more of the Company’s total bank deposits as at March 31, 2024.

The cost of the right-of-use asset measured at inception shall comprise of the amount of the initial measurement of the lease liability adjusted for any lease payments made at or before the commencement date less any lease incentives received, plus any initial direct costs incurred and an estimate of costs to be incurred by the lessee in dismantling and removing the underlying asset or restoring the underlying asset or site on which it is located. The right-of-use asset is subsequently measured at cost less any accumulated depreciation, accumulated impairment losses, if any and adjusted for any remeasurement of the lease liability. The right-of-use asset is depreciated using the straight-line method from the commencement date over the shorter of lease term or useful life of right-of-use asset. The estimated useful lives of right-of-use assets are determined on the same basis as those of property, plant and equipment. Right-of-use assets are tested for impairment whenever there is any indication that their carrying amounts may not be recoverable. Impairment loss, if any, is recognised in the statement of profit and loss.\\n The Company measur\\nes the lease liability at the present value of the lease payments that are not paid at the commencement \\ndate of the lease. The lease payments are discounted using the interest rate implicit in the lease, if that rate can be readily determined. If that rate cannot be readily determined, the Company uses incremental borrowing rate. For leases with reasonably similar characteristics, the Company, on a lease-by-lease basis, may adopt either the incremental borrowing rate specific to the lease or the incremental borrowing rate for the portfolio as a whole. The lease payments shall include fixed payments, variable lease payments, residual value guarantees, exercise price of a purchase option where the Company is reasonably certain to exercise that option and payments of penalties for terminating the lease, if the lease term reflects the lessee exercising an option to terminate the lease. The lease liability is subsequently remeasured by increasing the carrying amount to reflect interest on the lease liability, reducing the carrying amount to reflect the lease payments made and remeasuring the carrying amount to reflect any reassessment or lease modifications or to reflect revised in-substance fixed lease payments. The Company recognises the amount of the re-measurement of lease liability due to modification as an adjustment to the right-of-use asset and statement of profit and loss depending upon the nature of modification. Where the carrying amount of the right-of-use asset is reduced to zero and there is a further reduction in the measurement of the lease liability, the Company recognises any remaining amount of the re-measurement in statement of profit and loss.\\n The Company has elect\\ned not to apply the requirements of Ind AS 116 - Leases to short-term leases of all assets that have a lease \\nterm of 12 months or less and leases for which the underlying asset is of low value. The lease payments associated with these leases are recognised as an expense on a straight-line basis over the lease term. Notes forming part of Standalone Financial Statements\\nIntegrated Annual Report 2023-24275 Standalone Financial Statements 2023-24\\n Company as a lessor\\n At the incep\\ntion of the lease the Company classifies each of its leases as either an operating lease or a finance lease. The \\nCompany recognises lease payments received under operating leases as income on a straight-line basis over the lease term.  In \\ncase of a finance lease, finance income is recognised over the lease term based on a pattern reflecting a constant periodic rate of return on the lessor’s net investment in the lease. When the Company is an intermediate lessor it accounts for its interests in the head lease and the sub-lease separately. It assesses the lease classification of a sub-lease with reference to the right-of-use asset arising from the head lease, not with reference to the underlying asset. If a head lease is a short-term lease to which the Company applies the exemption described above, then it classifies the sub-lease as an operating lease.\\n If an arrang\\nement contains lease and non-lease components, the Company applies Ind AS 115 - Revenue from contracts with \\ncustomers to allocate the consideration in the contract.\\n The det\\nails of the right-of-use assets held by the Company is as follows:\\n(` crore)\\nAdditions for  \\nthe year ended  \\nMarch 31, 2024Net carrying \\namount as at  \\nMarch 31, 2024\\nLeasehold land  -     928 \\nBuildings  1,489  5,010 \\nLeasehold improvement  -     1 \\nComputer equipment  124  152 \\nSoftware licences  -     60 \\nVehicles  1  1 \\nFurniture and fixtures  2  2 \\n  1,616   6,154\\n(` crore)\\nAdditions for  \\nthe year ended  \\nMarch 31, 2023Net carrying \\namount as at  \\nMarch 31, 2023\\nLeasehold land  179  940 \\nBuildings  799  4,608 \\nLeasehold improvement  -     2 \\nComputer equipment  -     49 \\nSoftware licences  -     96 \\nVehicles  -    -*\\n   978   5,695\\n *Repr\\nesents value less than `0.50 crore.\\n Deprecia\\ntion on right-of-use assets is as follows:\\n(` crore)\\nYear ended  \\nMarch 31, 2024Year ended  \\nMarch 31, 2023\\nLeasehold land  11  10 \\nBuildings  1,079  1,034 \\nLeasehold improvement  1  2 \\nComputer equipment  21  16 \\nSoftware licences  36  37 \\nVehicles  -*  -* \\nFurniture and fixtures  -*  -  \\n  1,148   1,099\\n *Repr\\nesents value less than `0.50 crore.

The Company offers a \\nconsulting-led, cognitive powered, integrated portfolio of IT, business and engineering services and solutions. \\n Re\\nvenue is recognised upon transfer of control of promised products or services to customers in an amount that reflects the \\nconsideration which the Company expects to receive in exchange for those products or services.\\n • Re\\nvenue from time and material and job contracts is recognised on output basis measured by units delivered, efforts \\nexpended, number of transactions processed, etc. \\n • Re\\nvenue related to fixed price maintenance and support services contracts where the Company is standing ready to provide \\nservices is recognised based on time elapsed mode and revenue is straight-lined over the period of performance. \\n • In respect of other fix\\ned-price contracts, revenue is recognised using percentage-of-completion method (‘POC method’) of \\naccounting with contract costs incurred determining the degree of completion of the performance obligation. The contract \\ncosts used in computing the revenues include cost of fulfilling warranty obligations.  \\n • Re\\nvenue from the sale of distinct internally developed software and manufactured systems and third party software \\nis recognised upfront at the point in time when the system / software is delivered to the customer. In cases where implementation and / or customisation services rendered significantly modifies or customises the software, these services and software are accounted for as a single performance obligation and revenue is recognised over time on a POC method.\\n • Re\\nvenue from the sale of distinct third party hardware is recognised at the point in time when control is transferred to the \\ncustomer. \\n • The solutions offer\\ned by the Company may include supply of third-party equipment or software. In such cases, revenue for \\nsupply of such third party products are recorded at gross or net basis depending on whether the Company is acting as the principal or as an agent of the customer. The Company recognises revenue in the gross amount of consideration when it is acting as a principal and at net amount of consideration when it is acting as an agent.\\n Re\\nvenue is measured based on the transaction price, which is the consideration, adjusted for volume discounts, service level \\ncredits, performance bonuses, price concessions and incentives, if any, as specified in the contract with the customer. Revenue also excludes taxes collected from customers. Notes forming part of Standalone Financial Statements\\nIntegrated Annual Report 2023-24283 Standalone Financial Statements 2023-24\\n The Company ’s contracts with customers could include promises to transfer multiple products and services to a customer. The \\nCompany assesses the products / services promised in a contract and identifies distinct performance obligations in the contract. \\nIdentification of distinct performance obligation involves judgement to determine the deliverables and the ability of the customer to benefit independently from such deliverables.\\n Judgemen\\nt is also required to determine the transaction price for the contract and to ascribe the transaction price to each \\ndistinct performance obligation. The transaction price could be either a fixed amount of customer consideration or variable consideration with elements such as volume discounts, service level credits, performance bonuses, price concessions and incentives. The transaction price is also adjusted for the effects of the time value of money if the contract includes a significant financing component. Any consideration payable to the customer is adjusted to the transaction price, unless it is a payment for a distinct product or service from the customer. The estimated amount of variable consideration is adjusted in the transaction price only to the extent that it is highly probable that a significant reversal in the amount of cumulative revenue recognised will not occur and is reassessed at the end of each reporting period. The Company allocates the elements of variable considerations to all the performance obligations of the contract unless there is observable evidence that they pertain to one or more distinct performance obligations.\\n The Company e\\nxercises judgement in determining whether the performance obligation is satisfied at a point in time or over a \\nperiod of time. The Company considers indicators such as how customer consumes benefits as services are rendered or who controls the asset as it is being created or existence of enforceable right to payment for performance to date and alternate use of such product or service, transfer of significant risks and rewards to the customer, acceptance of delivery by the customer, etc.\\n Re\\nvenue from subsidiaries is recognised based on transaction price which is at arm’s length.\\n Contr\\nact fulfilment costs are generally expensed as incurred except for certain software licence costs which meet the criteria for \\ncapitalisation. Such costs are amortised over the contractual period or useful life of licence, whichever is less. The assessment of this criteria requires the application of judgement, in particular when considering if costs generate or enhance resources to be used to satisfy future performance obligations and whether costs are expected to be recovered.\\n Contr\\nact assets are recognised when there are excess of revenues earned over billings on contracts. Contract assets are classified \\nas unbilled receivables (only act of invoicing is pending) when there is unconditional right to receive cash, and only passage of time is required, as per contractual terms.\\n Unearned and def\\nerred revenue (“contract liability”) is recognised when there are billings in excess of revenues.\\n The billing schedules agreed with cus\\ntomers include periodic performance based payments and / or milestone based progress \\npayments.

This plan is a defined benefit plan as the Company is obligated to provide its members a rate of return which should, at the minimum, meet the interest rate declared by Government administered provident fund. A part of the Company’s contribution is transferred to Government administered pension fund. The contributions made by the Company and the shortfall of interest, if any, are recognised as an expense in statement of profit and loss under employee benefit expenses. In accordance with an actuarial valuation of provident fund liabilities on the basis of guidance issued by Actuarial Society of India and based on the assumptions as mentioned below, there is no deficiency in the interest cost as the present value of the expected future earnings of the fund is greater than the expected amount to be credited to the individual members based on the expected guaranteed rate of interest of Government administered provident fund.

Deferred income tax assets and liabilities are recognised \\nfor deductible and taxable temporary differences arising between the tax base of assets and liabilities and their carrying amount, except when the deferred income tax arises from the initial recognition of an asset or liability in a transaction that is not a business combination, affects neither accounting nor taxable profit or loss at the time of the transaction.\\n Def\\nerred income tax assets are recognised to the extent that it is probable that taxable profit will be available against which the \\ndeductible temporary differences and the carry forward of unused tax credits and unused tax losses can be utilised.\\n The carr\\nying amount of deferred income tax assets is reviewed at each reporting date and reduced to the extent that it is no \\nlonger probable that sufficient taxable profit will be available to allow all or part of the deferred income tax asset to be utilised.\\n Def\\nerred tax assets and liabilities are measured using substantively enacted tax rates expected to apply to taxable income in the \\nyears in which the temporary differences are expected to be received or settled.\\n For oper\\nations carried out in SEZs, deferred tax assets or liabilities, if any, have been established for the tax consequences of those \\ntemporary differences between the carrying values of assets and liabilities and their respective tax bases that reverse after the tax holiday ends.\\n Def\\nerred tax assets and liabilities are offset when they relate to income taxes levied by the same taxation authority and the \\nrelevant entity intends to settle its current tax assets and liabilities on a net basis.\\n Def\\nerred tax assets include Minimum Alternate Tax (MAT) paid in accordance with the tax laws in India, to the extent it would be \\navailable for set off against future current income tax liability. Accordingly, MAT is recognised as deferred tax asset in the balance sheet when the asset can be measured reliably and it is probable that the future economic benefit associated with the asset will be realised.\\n The income t\\nax expense consists of the following:\\n(` crore)\\nYear ended  \\nMarch 31, 2024Year ended  \\nMarch 31, 2023\\nCurrent tax\\nCurrent tax expense for current year  14,422  13,623 \\nCurrent tax benefit pertaining to prior years  (244)  (677)\\n 14,178  12,946 \\nDeferred taxDeferred tax benefit for current year  (135)  (362)\\n (135)  (362)\\n 14,043  12,584  Notes forming part of Standalone Financial Statements\\nIntegrated Annual Report 2023-24294 Standalone Financial Statements 2023-24\\n The reconciliation of estimated income tax expense at statutory income tax rate to income tax expense reported in statement of \\npr\\nofit and loss is as follows:\\n(` crore)\\nYear ended  \\nMarch 31, 2024Year ended  \\nMarch 31, 2023\\nProfit before taxes  57,602  51,690 \\nIndian statutory income tax rate 34.94% 34.94%\\nExpected income tax expense  20,128  18,063 \\nTax effect of adjustments to reconcile expected income tax expense to reported income tax expense\\nTax holidays  (6,393)  (5,097)\\nIncome exempt from tax  (1,152)  (736)\\nUndistributed earnings in branches  (35)  58 \\nTax on income at different rates  1,313  963 \\nTax pertaining to prior years  (244)  (677)\\nEffect of tax rate change under new regime  441  -    \\nOthers (net)  (15)  10 \\nTotal income tax expense\\n 14,043  12,584 \\n The Company bene\\nfits from the tax holiday available for units set up under the Special Economic Zone Act, 2005.

Subsequently, \\nTCFD fulfilled its remit and was disbanded in October 2023. \\nThe International Sustainability Standards Board (ISSB) released IFRS S2, Climate-related Disclosures, in January 2024, which is aligned \\nwith the recommendations of TCFD. This year, TCS has disclosed information related to climate-related risk and opportunities aligned with IFRS S2. IFRS S2 applies to disclosure of (1) climate related risks (physical and transitional), to which the entity is exposed and (2) climate related opportunities available to the entity. \\nThe disclosure requirements in IFRS S2 are structured around the core content related to the following sections: Section 1: Governance\\nSection 2: StrategySection 3: Risk ManagementSection 4: Metrics and TargetsEach of the above topics are addressed below.\\nSection 1: Governance\\nTCS has a Board level Stakeholder Relationship Committee (SRC) that oversees different aspects of climate-related risks and opportunities. \\nStakeholder Relationship Committee (SRC)•\\n The SRC is chair\\ned by an independent director and comprises of 3 members including the CEO. It reviews the climate change \\nstrategy, approach, and performance of the organization with respect to sustainability and climate change. \\n• The SRC f\\normally meets twice every year to review policies and sustainability performance, including climate change and carbon \\nperformance. The board oversight helps drive the program effectively with greater accountability. \\n• The CEO\\n, as a part of the SRC, is directly responsible for the efficient operations of the facility and hence is better able to review \\nperformance and drive improvement. The updates are provided by the Chief Human Resources Officer (CHRO) and is supported by \\nthe Head - Environmental Sustainability, Health and Safety (ESHS) who oversees the environment and climate change implementation at the organisation. \\n•\\n TCS\\n’ carbon reduction goal to reduce its absolute greenhouse gas emissions across Scope 1 and Scope 2 by 70% by 2025 (over 2016 \\nbase year), and to achieve net zero emissions by 2030, was reviewed and approved by the committee.\\n• Sta\\ntement by Senior management: Refer page number 132 in BRSR for N G Subramaniam, COO & Executive Director’s statement. \\n• During the half yearly mee\\ntings, the SRC monitors the progress towards the carbon targets and the carbon reduction initiatives that \\nhave been implemented and planned.\\nCompetency: \\nTCS has a competent team working on Environmental Sustainability. TCS’ Head - Environmental Sustainability, Health, and Safety (ESHS) is \\na Doctorate in Environmental Science and Engineering and has over 30 years of post-doctoral experience in environmental sustainability and climate change.  The ESHS team has recruited professionals who have the requisite qualification and experience in climate change and environmental sustainability. The team has undergone training in advanced topics and regularly participates in external training programs and sessions on the emerging frameworks and regulatory requirements around climate change.\\nTCS is also a member of the Confederation of Indian Industries (CII) and National Association of Software and Services Companies \\n(NASSCOM), and the company participates as panelist, assessor, or speaker in their training and capacity building workshops on climate change with the perspective of spreading know-how on ESG, climate change mitigation and adaptation strategies among other industries.  \\nRemuneration:  Refer page number 103 for information on remuneration of the Board members.\\nApart from the SRC, TCS also has the Risk Management Committee (RMC) that is responsible for risk management oversight at the \\ncorporate level.\\nRisk Management Committee (RMC)•\\n The RMC is chaired b\\ny an independent director and comprises of 5 members including one additional independent director, 2 \\nexecutive directors, i.e. CEO, COO, and one company executive, CFO.  Integrated Annual Report 2023-24319 Sustainability Disclosures\\n• The RMC formula tes, monitors, and reviews the company’s risk management policy.\\n• Climat\\ne change risks and opportunities are covered under the strategic and operational risks for the Company and are reviewed in \\nthe RMC committee meetings.\\nSection 2: Strategy\\nClimate related risks continue to challenge businesses in every possible way, sometimes amplifying existing risks. Not only is their nature \\nevolving, but their speed of impacting the organisation’s operations is also increasing. Operating in an uncertain and ever-changing environment, TCS’ global operations bring in considerable complexities and TCS’ robust enterprise risk management framework aids in ensuring the strategic objectives are achieved. This framework enables risk identification for short, medium, and long term, risk assessment, risk response planning and actions, risk monitoring and overall risk governance.\\nClimate-related risks and opportunitiesRefer to the MD&A section on page number 86 of the TCS Integrated Annual Report for identified climate-related risk and opportunities \\nthat could reasonably affect TCS’ prospects. The section includes the company’s adaptation methodology which will be implemented over following time horizons:\\n Time-horizon From (y ears) To (years)\\nShort-term 0 5\\nMedium-term 5 10\\nLong-term 10 Beyond 10\\nBelow is a brief description of TCS’ approach and identification of climate-related risks and opportunities. \\nClimate related \\nR&OTCS Approach\\nCurrent regulation Regulations undergo frequent changes and, to accommodate such changes, the company must be aware and \\nresponsive. In India operations, TCS must comply with all the environmental consent conditions around emissions, water discharge, waste recycling etc. These regulations are included in TCS’ risk assessment as compliance risk and thereafter integrated into its mitigation plans. The company also reports to the Securities and Exchange Board of India (SEBI) mandated BRSR framework, which includes non-financial indicators and is a part of this Integrated Annual report. This year as per BRSR reporting requirements, TCS is also undergoing reasonable assurance for the core indicators of BRSR.\\nEmerging regulationEmerging regulations including carbon taxes (coal or fossil fuel taxes leading to escalation in the electricity tariff), mandatory energy audits are examples which are likely to impact the company. Regulations around procurement of renewable energy, which is a key driver of the company’s climate change mitigation plan, is also ever evolving in all major geographies. TCS keeps a close watch on the emerging regulations and plans its organizational sustainability strategy and roadmap to adapt to those changes.\\nTechnology With more energy efficient and eco-friendly building and IT equipment coming in the market, keeping TCS’ offices \\neco-efficient is an ongoing process wherein the company evaluates the technology and suitability and work on a phaseout plan to move to the new more efficient technology. These are considered as operational risks and opportunities which drive the company to make its infrastructure more climate resilient.\\nLegal TCS tracks environmental legal compliance (air emissions, water discharges, waste management and others) on periodic basis and have a very robust internal compliance management system to identify and comply with all legal requirements of current, amended and new regulations. While the possibility of a litigation risk is very low, climate change impacts can pose few risks indirectly to TCS.\\nMarket Climate change is driving a lot of changes in the company’s customer behaviour, thus creating new markets and new opportunities, giving TCS an opportunity to partner with them in their climate change mitigation journey by providing solutions, services, and process automation which helps in emission reduction.\\nReputation Reputational risk is relevant to the company as the investor and customer community is becoming increasingly \\naware of climate change related issues. It is important to demonstrate leadership in climate action to maintain reputation. Climate risks are hence included as strategic risks which is reviewed by leadership to position the company better in the market. This information is required to respond to CDP supply chain module and various customer surveys on sustainability like Dow Jones Sustainability Index, EcoVadis, MSCI, Sustainalytics, etc. Hence performing well in these ratings/scorings is very crucial in maintaining the market reputation which the organization holds.\\nAcute physical Acute physical risks associated with extreme weather events is relevant as TCS has substantial operations in coastal \\ncities in India which are exposed to extreme weather events like heavy precipitation, flood, and cyclones. E.g., The company’s offices located in coastal cities like Chennai, Bhubaneshwar, Kolkata, Kochi are exposed to physical risks from cyclonic events and therefore adequate mitigation plans are in place.  Integrated Annual Report 2023-24320 Sustainability Disclosures\\nClimate related \\nR&OTCS Approach\\nChronic physical Despite the Paris Agreement and global climate action, global warming continues unabated. Having presence in many major cities across the world, TCS is subject to climate change related chronic physical impacts like change in precipitation pattern, with resultant effects like drought or flood. Also, with TCS’s presence in few coastal cities, rise in sea level and related impacts like land submergence, saltwater intrusion, disruption to network and communication systems are more likely. These risks are long term and included from perspective of planning appropriate infrastructure. TCS has set targets to reduce carbon emissions (scope 1 and 2) by 70% in 2025 compared to 2016 base year and achieve Net Zero by 2030. These are aligned with the global goals taken under the Paris agreement to fight global warming by keeping the planet’s temperature below 1.5 degrees Celsius. TCS has reduced its absolute carbon footprint across Scope 1 and Scope 2 by 80% in FY 2024 over a baseline of 2016, exceeding TCS’ target achievement by 10%, one year ahead of time.\\nBusiness model and value chain\\nTCS’ business model and value chain includes its customers and suppliers. The sustainability and climate related transition risks are \\ncovered here along with some mitigation plans.\\nCustomers: TCS is an IT services and business solution provider company working mostly with Fortune 1000 or Global 2000 corporations \\nand the public sector. The customer perception around climate change risks has strengthened, especially in the major markets, and this is reflected in the increasing customer requests on climate change performance through platforms like CDP , SBTi commitment, RFPs. These all show how adapting to changing customer behaviour around climate change is crucial for business continuity.\\nTCS’ stakeholders, especially its customers and employees look at it as a responsible corporate citizen when it comes to climate action. \\nThe company’s efforts in this domain have been recognized through ESG ratings and CDP ratings / climate change performance (carbon reduction against targets, % renewable energy). In an event, if TCS is unable to meet its climate change commitments, it can lead to a negative impact on its brand and reputation, as well as ESG ratings. A failure to meet the targets, customer expectations or evolving regulatory requirements could also potentially affect its market capitalization. TCS ensures that these risks are identified at an early stage and work on mitigation and improvement plans. \\nThe company also has a robust business continuity plan. It is an end-to-end framework that effectively manages through defined policy, \\nprocedures, guidelines and through in-house developed tools that support planning and communication with all stakeholders. The framework is fully compliant and certified to ISO 22301:2019, CMMI-SVC and is integrated with TCS quality management system for consistent deployment across the organization. TCS also has Emergency Preparedness Plans (EPP) for disasters such as earthquake, floods, cyclones etc in its internal portal. The plan outlays the responsibilities of action owners, plan description including precautions to be taken, evacuation procedures and post incident action plan which would need to be followed at locations facing the emergency scenario.\\nSuppliers: Towards ongoing sustainability assessment, TCS launched its Supplier Sustainability Assessment Platform in FY 2023 and \\ninitiated on-boarding of its top supply chain partners. Through this platform, TCS plans to support its suppliers with engagement and guidance to help them improve their sustainability performance. In FY 2024, the company has successfully assessed 17% of its value chain partners (by spend) for sustainability criteria. These efforts ensure that all suppliers who form upstream part of the value chain are assessed for sustainability and climate risks. \\nStrategy and decision-makingClimate-related risks and opportunities have influenced TCS’ strategy in the following ways:\\n Area Description of in fluence\\nProducts and \\nservicesAs TCS’ customers respond to climate change actions, the company is seeing opportunities to provide technology-led solutions to help them achieve their sustainability goals. The change in technology consumption reflects the prevailing trends in the economy. Recent events have accelerated digital adoption, put the spotlight on supply chain resilience and added urgency to the sustainability imperative. Each of these represents an opportunity that can contribute towards the growth of not just as one company, but of the ecosystem. TCS leveraged its deep expertise in IoT, advanced analytics, and machine learning to come up with a suite of offerings in this space, including intellectual property such as Clever Energy™, IP2™, and TCS Envirozone™. Clients across industries are engaging us to develop innovative technology led solutions to reduce energy consumption, or to measure and track green-house gas emissions across their end-to-end supply chain, reduce their carbon footprint, reduce waste and promote recycling. Integrated Annual Report 2023-24321 Sustainability Disclosures\\n Area Description of in fluence\\nSupply chain and/\\nor value chainSupply Chain sustainability through responsible sourcing is one of the risk mitigations that TCS has identified under its sustainability risk. TCS’s Green Procurement policy outlines its commitment to making its supply chain more responsible and sustainable. Energy efficiency is one of the major procurement considerations in all the company’s IT assets procurement as this is directly correlated with its emission profile. Climate related risks play a very important role in supply chain engagements, and TCS is working with its suppliers to bring in improvements in overall supply chain sustainability related aspects. As mentioned in the previous section on suppliers, TCS has launched the supplier sustainability assessment platform to facilitate improvements in the supply chain through evaluation and assessment of suppliers.\\nInvestment in R&I TCS’ investments in R&I have resulted in solutions like Envirozone™, Clever Energy and IP2™. TCS has been using Clever Energy for the last several years to monitor and help reduce its energy consumption and is now commercially selling it and the other two solutions to clients to help them achieve their sustainability goals. Additionally, TCS has been investing in building green campuses (IGBC certified). These initiatives have enabled reduction of carbon footprint\\nOperations Climate Change risks play an important consideration in TCS’ operations. TCS has created an environmentally sustainable approach by creating green policies, processes, frameworks, and infrastructure. The company’s campuses are designed to withstand extreme weather events and the business continuity plans are tested periodically to ensure continued operations without any disruption. Green buildings, efficient operations, green IT, the use of renewable energy to reduce carbon footprint; adoption of newer technologies and methods to manage waste in line with circular economy principles are integral to business operations. These all help the company in achieving its emission reduction targets and journey towards Net Zero by 2030.\\nDirect costs, Capital expenditures, Capital allocation assetsClimate risks and opportunities are one of the factors while making financial considerations especially while making investments in offices, equipment, and renewable energy production. Investment in these areas constitutes a substantial share of the company’s overall capital investment. Major investments are in green buildings, roof top solar and other energy efficiency initiatives. Refer BRSR section, Principle 6, page number 152, 153 for more details on the initiatives that also help the company to position itself as leaders in the climate domain hence contribute substantially to its market value.\\nFinancial position, financial performance, and cash flows\\nSubstantive financial or strategic impact of Risk Assessment: Climate risks like business disruption, changing regulatory landscape, acute physical stress and transition risks are identified, prioritized, \\nassessed and managed by the ERM team. Anything with the potential to disrupt regular operations by more than 10% and triggers Business Continuity Plans at the sites is considered as substantial. The financial risk exposure is calculated considering the following quantifiable indicators - (1) Proportion of business units affected OR percentage of operations impacted; (2) Probability of occurrence of extreme climate related events, and 3) the impact potential at the affected locations based on size of operation. In any given year the overall potential financial impact due to an extreme weather event is considered as 0.75% of the revenue. TCS considers a risk tolerance of 10% of the exposure for climate related risks and considered as substantive. Based on the severity and the risk exposure, the appropriate risk response is finalized, and mitigation actions are assigned to relevant functions.\\nThe company has identified the following climate-related risks with the potential to have a substantive financial or strategic impact on the \\ncompany’s business:\\na.\\n Risk of impact on direct oper\\nations:  TCS has large operations based out of offices in coastal cities which have a high exposure to \\nextreme weather events like high rainfall, cyclones, rise in sea level, etc. During FY 2024, there were no major cyclones that effected \\nthe company’s campuses. However, earlier event like Cyclone Amphan led to damages in its Kolkata, India campus specifically to the rooftop solar PV installations, solar water heater panels, roof mounted HVAC components, HRW electrical panel room, energy bin of biogas chamber, apart from multiple water leakages at basement and many other external physical damages. This indicates the increased severity and frequency of extreme weather events such as cyclones and floods and the impact these can cause directly on the operations. TCS accounts for such risks at design stage through cyclone and flood water resistance considerations while constructing new buildings. For greenfield projects, the building structure is designed (a) for seismic load as per IS 1893 (Part-1) 2016; Amendment No:2-2020 and (b) for wind speeds as per IS 875 codes. \\n TCS has a s\\ntrong business continuity plan (critical business operations can be shifted to another city/country/geography) and \\ntherefore these physical risks will not affect the business operations significantly, except for the financial implications related to infrastructure damages (if any). Hence the potential financial impact due to physical damage because of extreme weather events is calculated as a percentage of revenue using a risk factor, which in turn is arrived through the company’s risk assessment exercises. The potential financial impact will be 0.75% of the revenue which comes to approximately ₹ 1,807 crores or US$218 million.\\nb.\\n Risk of increase in c\\napital expenditure: TCS is an IT services, consulting, and business solutions organization with a presence across \\nmultiple geographies, industries, services and products. Being one of the frontrunners in ESG performance, in 2021, the company has taken up ambitious carbon targets as mentioned in previous sections and have also achieved its near-term targets 2 years ahead  Integrated Annual Report 2023-24322 Sustainability Disclosures\\nof timelines. In FY 2024, TCS has further brought down its Scope 1 and Scope 2 emission by 80% over base year 2016.  This was \\ndespite increased electricity consumption in FY 2024 from employees’ return to office and addition of new offices to the reporting boundary. Apart from organizational level commitments, the emerging regulations also motivate TCS to transition towards low carbon business. TCS will need additional CAPEX and OPEX to ensure compliance. The company has envisaged this as a risk, and is developing greener solutions and transitioning to renewable energy. In FY 2024, RE accounts for 74% of total energy and have increased percentage of green tariff.\\n i. TCS\\n’ new campuses are designed according to green building standards for energy and resource efficiency to reduce the carbon \\nfootprint. The company invests in energy efficiency initiatives taking into consideration a payback period of 4-5 years. It is also retrofitting its older buildings with energy efficient equipment. \\n ii. TCS\\n’ IoT-based Real-time Energy Management System (TCS Clever Energy™) initiative that involves real time monitoring to \\noptimize the operational energy efficiency is used across all offices. This smart, scalable, analytics driven IoT solution uses TCS Connected Universe Platform (TCUP) IoT platform, which forms the backbone enabling visualization of data acquired from various locations and facilities’ energy meters and sensors. \\n iii. While the abov\\ne initiatives were carried out across TCS India campuses, focus towards achieving Net Zero is also driven through \\ncarbon neutrality across Scope 1 and Scope 2 emissions in North America, UK and Ireland, Europe, Asia Pacific, Japan, Latin America, and Middle East & Africa.\\nc.\\n Risk of Impacting Reput\\nation and Brand Value: TCS is an IT services company working mostly with Fortune 1000 or Global 2000 \\ncorporations and the public sector. The customer perception around climate change risks has strengthened, especially in the major markets, and this is reflected in the increasing customer requests on climate change performance through platforms like CDP , SBTi commitments, RFPs and other surveys/ questionnaires. Thus, in an event if TCS is unable to meet its climate change commitments, it can impact the company’s brand and reputation, as well as international ESG ratings. The risk due to the same is realized in terms of the company’s brand value and the risk is estimated as 0.1% of the same. In FY 2024, TCS brand value rose to US$19.2 billion (Source: Brand Finance). Hence, the potential financial impact due to this risk is estimated at US$19.2 million. To mitigate these impacts, the company has undertaken many initiatives to mitigate its environmental impact which includes green building design, energy efficient building and IT infrastructure, and transition to renewable energy. All the stakeholders are well informed about TCS’ climate change performance through its external disclosures which helps to minimize the reputational risks. \\n TCS has iden\\ntified the following climate-related opportunities with the potential to have a substantive financial or strategic impact on \\nits business:\\n i. TCS h\\nas a large building footprint with its campuses alone covering more than 38 million sq. ft area in India. Out of this, over 67.3% \\nof its buildings are certified to IGBC Green Building standards. TCS has steadily increased its portfolio of green buildings, thereby ensuring energy efficiency in its buildings and reducing both emissions and operating expenditures. Apart from this, the company is also working on improving and upgrading its energy efficiency in existing buildings. Few years back, TCS India took up a major project to change the luminaires to LEDs across its locations which contributed towards significant energy savings. Major retrofits were carried out at some locations with legacy infrastructure to improve the efficiency levels. The TCS Remote Energy Management and Control program witnessed rapid scaling up and further maturity during the year by leveraging IoT platform to acquire asset (chillers, air handling units, etc.) level data which is analyzed to improve asset efficiency and operations. The data center PUE (weighted average) of 1.70 was achieved for the corporate data centers at Mumbai and Chennai. In FY 2024, TCS has achieved a saving to the tune of 16,301 MWh due to energy saving initiatives. (This includes HVAC energy efficiency projects, UPS based energy efficiency projects, expansion in green buildings and real time monitoring of energy efficiency). TCS uses multiple energy sources in its daily operations, electricity being the primary source. Majority of the electricity comes from conventional sources, but TCS has increased the share of renewable electricity (RE) over the years through onsite rooftop solar generation, third party procurement and purchase of Energy Attribute Certificate (EAC) (in select geographies). The RE consumption as a percentage of total electricity consumption has increased from 15.6% in FY 2021 to 74% in FY 2024. TCS’ owned roof top solar projects contribute 3 % of the same. Apart from roof top solar photo voltaic installations, TCS increased the renewable energy procurement through a switch over to green tariffs for operations and open access power purchase agreements (PPA).\\n ii. TCS is looking a\\nt developing solutions that respond to changing consumer behaviour. Through its Connected Marketing team, \\nTCS uses sustainability in the social media perspective to better understand the ‘green’ needs of its consumers, and to also see how consumers are reacting to the new green products that have been introduced. Changing consumer behaviour and expectations are most reflective in the power utility space. Towards this area, TCS has developed several strategic partnerships, towards thought-leadership development and solution enhancement (Example: Smart Power and Smart Energy are key solution areas of TCS’ Utilities Industry Unit). \\nClimate Resilience \\nA brief description of the resilience of the organization’s strategy, taking into consideration different climate-related scenarios, including a \\n2oC or lower scenario. Integrated Annual Report 2023-24323 Sustainability Disclosures\\nClimate related  \\nscenarioParameters, assumptions, analytical choices\\nTransition scenarios IEA B2DSThe climate change scenario analysis conducted for TCS takes a multi-level approach to identify climate risk and opportunity hot spots, interdependencies, and interaction with global macro trends. The top-down analysis of the macro environmental trends that will impact the company at global level included,\\na)\\n natu\\nre loss and ecological degradation, \\nb) resour\\nce scarcity and driving value chain innovation, \\nc) changing cus\\ntomer and workforce preferences, \\nd) the rise of e\\nxtreme weather, \\ne) increasing r\\negulations, pricing and disclosure of externalities, \\nf) digit\\nalization and prevalence of infectious diseases and \\ng) rising inc\\nomes.\\nDetailed analysis was conducted of material climate change transition risks and opportunities across value chain \\nand assessment of interdependencies between climate risks and opportunities including identification of areas of potential magnification and hedge opportunities. The key value driver analysis assesses climate risks and opportunities across 3 stages of the value chain including a) Supply Chain (input supplies costs, disruption and access to supplies) b) Operations (carbon costs, operating costs, insurance/ damage costs due to disruption of operation) and c) End Markets (demand for low carbon services/ products, market share and competition). In the transition scenario, the IEA B2DS approach has been selected as its more conservative scenario. The inputs included those from Intergovernmental Panel for Climate Change (IPCC) reports, the Nationally Determined Contributions (NDCs), the Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs) and Government of India plan on energy efficiency and solar energy. The assumptions used in the analysis also considered the anticipated growth of TCS over the years and increased energy demand. Changing customer behaviour and carbon costs are assessed as a transition risk to TCS with a growing number of jurisdictions at regional and national level planning to implement a carbon tax or emission trading scheme.\\nPhysical  climate  scenarios RCP 8.5The climate change scenario analysis conducted for TCS takes a multi-level approach to identify climate risk and opportunity hot spots, interdependencies, and interaction with global macro trends. The top-down analysis of the macro environmental trends that will impact the company at global level included,\\na)\\n natu\\nre loss and ecological degradation, \\nb) resour\\nce scarcity and driving value chain innovation, \\nc) changing cus\\ntomer and workforce preferences, \\nd) the rise of e\\nxtreme weather, \\ne) increasing r\\negulations, pricing, and disclosure of externalities, \\nf) digit\\nalization and prevalence of infectious diseases and \\ng) rising inc\\nomes\\nDetailed analysis was conducted of material climate change physical risks and opportunities across value chain \\nand assessment of interdependencies between climate risks and opportunities including identification of areas of potential magnification and hedge opportunities. The key value drivers’ analysis assesses them across 3 stages of the value chain including a) Supply Chain (input supplies costs, disruption and access to supplies) b) Operations (carbon costs, operating costs, insurance/ damage costs due to disruption of operation) and c) End Markets (demand for low carbon services/ products, market share and competition) The physical risk is assessed using the RCP 8.5 scenario. The RCP 8.5 scenario takes a global warming between 3-4 degrees above pre-industrial levels which is a conservative scenario and helps TCS understand the worst-case climate impacts on its operations. The inputs included IPCC reports, the NDCs, the SDGs and Govt. of India plan on energy efficiency and solar energy. The assumptions used in the analysis also considered the anticipated growth of TCS over the years and increased energy demand. Few strategies to mitigate physical risks of climate change include:\\n1)\\n A robus\\nt Business Continuity Plan (BCP) to respond to climate events \\n2) Inv\\nestments in climate resilient infrastructure (for cyclone, floods).\\nSection 3: Risk management\\nAt TCS, the Corporate Risk Office, led by the Chief Risk Officer, is responsible for driving Enterprise Risk Management (ERM) across all functions in line with TCS Global Risk Management Policy. Refer the MD&A section on page numbers 78, for details on how ERM is driven across the company on all topics, including climate related risks and opportunities. The company also considers evolving concepts, trends, policies, customer requirements, regulations, and climate scenario analysis to identify Risk & Opportunities. The company also considers international guidelines/frameworks like GRI, SASB, and CDP for Risk & Opportunity drivers.\\nRisk Assessment Methodology: Refer the MD&A section page number 79 of the TCS Integrated Annual Report for information on \\nEnterprise Risk Management process followed at TCS. Integrated Annual Report 2023-24324 Sustainability Disclosures\\nAll climate-related risks are embedded into entity’s overall risk management process. TCS has an internal application where identified risks \\nare baselined at the beginning of the year, tracked quarterly and updated with relevant progress. Each risk has an expiry date. Each risk owner responds with the progress and at the end of the financial year ensures closing of the risk.\\nSection 4: Metrics and targets\\nClimate related metrics\\na.\\n Climat\\ne-related metrics – Scope 1,2 and 3 greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions in metric tons of CO2 equivalent are disclosed on \\npage number 152, 158 of the BRSR report. The emissions are in accordance with the GHG Protocol Corporate Accounting and \\nReporting Standards. TCS has a robust environmental sustainability tool where all relevant environmental data are collected monthly, validated, and internally assured periodically across geographies. All locations within the operational control of TCS are included in the boundary of environmental data reporting (consolidated accounting group as per IFRS-S2). GHG emission factors are used from the latest version of IEA, DEFRA, USEPA, GHG Protocol All Sector Tools and regional sources for specific geographies (e.g. CEA for India) to estimate the GHG emissions. The approach, inputs and assumptions are detailed on Page number 152, 158 as part of the BRSR section. The carbon emission data is independently assured by external assurance providers at the end of the financial year. In FY\\n 2024, sc\\nope 1 and 2 emissions have undergone reasonable assurance and scope 3 has been subject to limited assurance by \\nKPMG. TCS reports its scope 1, 2 and 3 emissions in the Integrated Annual Report and in CDP (Climate change) disclosures. \\nb.

Currently TCS does not apply this carbon price to determine the feasibility of projects or to apply a carbon tax to generate funding for the projects. All these projects and initiatives are driven through internal accruals since they align to overall company and Tata Group philosophy. Currently, TCS is not focusing on offsetting to drive reductions and the company may take up the carbon cost/tax mechanism in the future to generate budgets for purchase of offset instruments. In the coming years, the company may plan to consider applying a carbon tax to business travel (and employee commuting-company provided transport) to bring out the “carbon” cost. This will help reduce Category 6 and 7 of Scope 3 emissions by either reducing travel or switching to carbon efficient means of travel and transportation (like EVs). The price for each metric tonne of greenhouse gas emissions the entity uses to assess the costs of its greenhouse gas emissions is ₹ 2,365.\\n Business decision-making processes this in\\nternal carbon price is applied to are:\\n • Capital e\\nxpenditure \\n • Opera\\ntions procurement \\n • Risk managemen\\nt \\n • Opportunity managemen\\nt\\n • Value chain eng\\nagement\\nRemuneration:  Refer page number 103 for information on remuneration of the Board members. \\nClimate-related targets\\nTCS’ climate related targets are mentioned along with its metrics, timeline, and performance in page 24, 25 of the Natural Capital section. \\nIn May 2021, TCS set carbon target of 70% reduction of absolute Scope 1 + 2 emissions by 2025 (vs base year 2016) and Net Zero by 2030. This target setting is aimed to mitigate the carbon emissions from its activities and enables adapting to climate change risks. The target applies to the entity in entirety across geographies. TCS has already achieved 71% reduction in scope 1 and 2 emissions in FY 2023 (Vs 2016) and 80% reduction in FY 2024 (Vs 2016) thereby overachieving the targets much ahead of its timelines. \\nThe performance against the targets is disclosed in this Integrated Annual Report in the Natural Capital Section on Page numbers 24 and 25. TCS has made its commitment to SBTi targets. In June 2022, TCS has responded to SBTi’s urgent call for corporate climate action by \\ncommitting to align with 1.5°C and net-zero through the Business Ambition for 1.5°C campaign. This is published on SBTi website and can be viewed at Companies taking action - Science Based Targets. TCS is working towards submitting the targets for validation by SBTi. 1 Requirement 7: Publish a GRI Content Index\\n* MD&A: Manag\\nement Discussion and Analysis, CG: Corporate Governance Report, BRSR: Business Responsibility and Sustainability ReportGRI Content Index1\\nTCS’ Integrated Annual Report 2023-24, which includes the Board and Management Commentary, Compliance Reports, Financial \\nStatements, and the Business Responsibility and Sustainability Report, is with reference to the Global Reporting Initiative (GRI) Standard.

Consequently, the level of assurance obtained in a limited assurance engagement is substantially lower than the assurance that would have been obtained had a reasonable assurance engagement been performed.  \\n \\n  \\n \\n \\nShivananda Shetty  \\nPartner \\nKPMG Assurance and Consulting Services LLP  \\nDate: 08 May 2024 \\nPlace:  Mumbai \\n \\n \\n  \\n  \\n Integrated Annual Report 2023-24333 Sustainability Disclosures\\n \\n \\n \\n6 | Page  \\n Appendix – 1 \\nSelect BRSR and GRI attributes  \\nGRI Indicator  BRSR Linkage  Type of \\nAssurance  \\n302-1-(a), (b), (c) -i, (e)  \\nEnergy consumption within the \\norganization  P6 E1 - Details of total energy consumption (in Joules \\nor multiples)  Limited  \\n302-3 (a) Energy intensity  P6 E1 - Details of total energy intensity  Limited  \\n303-3-(a)-I, 303 -3-(a)-ii, 303 -3-\\n(a)-iii, 303-3-(a)-iv P6 E3 - Provide details of water withdrawal by source  Limited  \\n303-1-(a), 303 -2-(a), 303 -4  P6 E4 - Provide details of water discharged  Limited  \\n303-5 (a)  P6 E3 - Provide details of water consumption  Limited  \\n305-1 (a), (b), (c), (d), €Direct \\n(Scope 1) GHG emissions  P6 E7 - Provide details of greenhouse gas emissions \\n(Scope 1)  Limited  \\n305-2 (a), (b), (c), Energy indirect \\n(Scope 2) GHG emissions  P6 E7 - Provide details of greenhouse gas emissions \\n(Scope 2)  Limited  \\n305-4 (a), (b), GHG emissions \\nintensity  P6 E7 - Provide details of greenhouse gas emissions \\n(Scope 1 and Scope 2) intensity  Limited  \\n306-3- (a) Waste generated  P6 E9 - Provide details related to waste generated by \\ncategory of waste  Limited  \\n306-4-(a), (b -i), (b -ii), (b -iii), (c -i), \\n(c-ii), (c -iii) Waste diverted from \\ndisposal  P6 E9 - Provide details related to waste recovered \\nthrough recycling, re -using or other recovery \\noperations  Limited  \\n306-5-(a), (b -i), (b -ii), (b -iii), (c -i), \\n(c-ii), (c -iii), (c -iv) Waste directed \\nto disposal  P6 E9 - Provide details related to waste disposed by \\nnature of disposal method  Limited  \\n403-9- (a-i-v), 403-9- (b-i-v), \\nWork- related injuries  P3 E11 -Details of safety related incidents including \\nlost time injury frequency rate, recordable work-\\nrelated injuries, n o. of fatalities  Limited  \\n303-1 Interactions with water as a \\nshared resource  No direct Linkage Limited  \\n303-2 Management of water \\ndischarge -related impacts  No direct Linkage Limited  \\n 303-3-b- (i-iv), 303-4-a- (i-ii)  \\nWater withdrawal   P6 L 1- Water withdrawal, consumption, and \\ndischarge in areas of water stress (in kiloliters)  Limited  \\n303-1-(a), 303 -2-(a), 303 -4  \\n303-3-b- (i-iv), 303-4-a- (i-iv)  \\nWater discharge   P6 L 1- Water withdrawal, consumption, and \\ndischarge in areas of water stress (in kiloliters)  Limited  \\n303-5 (a)  \\n303-3-b- (i-iv), 303-4-a- (i-ii)  \\nConsumption  P6 L 1- Water withdrawal, consumption, and \\ndischarge in areas of water stress (in kiloliters)  Limited   Integrated Annual Report 2023-24334 Sustainability Disclosures\\n \\n \\n \\n7 | Page  \\n 304, 413 -1-(a-ii), 303 -1- (a), 303 -\\n1- (c)  \\nOperational sites owned, leased, \\nmanaged in, or adjacent to, \\nprotected areas and areas of high \\nbiodiversity value outside \\nprotected areas   P6 E11- If the entity has operations/offices in/around \\necologically sensitive areas where environmental \\napprovals /c learances are required, please specify the \\nlocation and type of operations and if the conditions \\nof environmental approval / clearance are being \\ncomplied with?
